Roll pizza dough out into a rectangle (about 18 inches by 12 inches), with the long side laid out left-to-right in front of you. Spread out feta cheese, zucchini and black olives evenly over the dough, leaving 3 inches from the edges of the crust uncovered. Spread the cooled meat mixture over the top, still leaving edges of dough uncovered. Starting with the edge closest to you, roll up the whole thing until it is all rolled up. You can do this by using the uncovered edge of dough at the end as a 'strip' to stick to the roll and seal it, making sure both ends are pressed down and sealed.  Sprinkle with garlic powder and bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Then, reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and bake for about 30 minutes, or until golden brown.

It's best to brine the meat overnight to help it retain moisture during smoking, but it's not necessary. There's a basic brine recipe on this site titled 'Basic Brine for Smoking' if you want to brine the pork. I like to rub the pork before I smoke it with a very spicy dry rub that I usually make up each time, so that it's always different. Also, I use apple wood chips because we like the sweet, fruity flavor they yield. When it's done, shred it apart, heat up your favorite sauce, and slather some on a bun. Authentic pit barbecue right in your own house!

Whip the potatoes with an electric mixer until smooth; pour the boiling milk over the potatoes, and add butter, nutmeg, salt, and white pepper. Whip on Medium speed until light and fluffy. These are, hands down, the best mashed potatoes I have ever had  -- and so very easy to make. You can also use soy milk and non-dairy butter for vegans.  I make a side batch vegan-style for my brother and his friends, and they say it tastes great. 
If the smoked cod has a strong smoky flavor, soak it in water for 30 minutes, drain, and rinse. In a large saucepan, cover the cod and smoked cod with water, and add the juice of half a lemon and the thyme.  Bring the cooking liquid to a gentle simmer.  Poach the fish for 8 to 10 minutes, or until the fish is just cooked and tender.  Remove the fish to a bowl, and reserve the poaching liquid.  When the fish has cooled enough to handle, break it into large bite-sized pieces.  Set aside. While the cod is cooking, peel the parsnips, and cut them into 1/4-inch-thick slices.  Peel the potatoes, cut them into 1/2 inch dice, and place them in a bowl of water to prevent discoloring. In a large saucepan or kettle, melt 2 tablespoons of butter or margarine over medium heat.  Add onion, and cook until wilted and golden.  Add the parsnips, potatoes, and 3 cups of the reserved poaching liquid.  Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and cover.  Simmer for 15 minutes, or until the vegetables are tender. Heat the milk and cream in a small saucepan.  Do not boil.  Stir to the vegetable mixture. Add cod and smoked cod; stir.  Season with salt and freshly ground pepper to taste.  Just before serving, stir in remaining tablespoon of butter.  Top each serving with freshly ground pepper and chives. A wonderful New England creation, merging the sweetness of parsnips with a smoky cod broth.  Good fish alternatives include haddock, pollack, cusk, or whiting.  Smoked haddock and smoked pollack are good substitutes for the smoked cod.  Use 1 1/2 pounds fresh cod alone if no lightly smoked fish is available.  Great on cool Autumn evenings!  Serve with hot, crusty bread and garnish with fresh chives.

He later used this at Blackstone Hotel in Kansas City, Drake Hotel in Chicago, and when he was Executive Chef at the Hotel Utah in Salt Lake City (where he was featured in Gourmet Magazine). This recipe won countless awards and was in national cooking magazines. Not as easy as other Caesar dressing recipes, but worth the effort! I guarantee it! Julia Child has a great Caesar dressing recipe, but this recipe beat hers in one contest. Chef Gerard suggested letting this dressing stay in the refrigerator for 2 days for better flavor. Optional, but suggested.

When I was old enough to realize that I needed to get her delicious recipes, she showed me how to make a lot of her wonderful dishes. She never wrote anything down and she rarely used a cookbook. She also didn't measure things the same each time, so sometimes you have to add a little to the recipes.

I was looking around for a name for this unusual clafoutis-like combination of peaches, blackberries, thyme, and black pepper. I saw an article that said in France a clafoutis that uses fruit other than cherries is called a flognarde. I enjoy saying flognarde so much that I think even if this recipe hadn't come out as well as it did I would still make it regularly, just to say 'flognarde'.

The combination of the cheeses and the pumpkin made it so very rich and creamy. The next time I decided to make this dish I added some cooked lobster I had left over, and from there I just fell in love. I have had lobster macaroni and cheese dishes before, but never anything like this. All of this may sound strange and unusual but once you try this dish you will never get it out of your head.

Stir cranberries into the oatmeal to distribute throughout the mixture; cook just until the berries are warmed, 2 to 3 minutes. I love instant oatmeal 'raisins and spice' flavor, but I wanted better oats, so this is my own twist.

Roll each type of dough into egg shapes, and place on a waxed paper-lined cookie sheet. Refrigerate until hard, at least an hour. Melt chocolate chips in a heat-proof bowl over a pan of simmering water. Stir occasionally until smooth. If the chocolate seems too thick for coating, stir in a teaspoon of the shortening or oil until it thins to your desired consistency. Dip the chilled candy eggs in chocolate, and return to the waxed paper lined sheet to set. Refrigerate for 1/2 hour to harden. This is a great recipe that you can add different ingredients to that will make 4 different kind of eggs...all yummy.  I always get tons of compliments when I make these.

As such, I improvised and changed a few things around from a zucchini bread recipe and created this healthy, hearty, summertime bread. It has a slightly different flavor than zucchini bread but the same moist consistency and sweet, summery taste and smell. Note: it is not very sweet and does taste 'healthy', so it's probably not a big hit for kids unless chocolate chips are added.

Add the chocolate and 2 tablespoons of sugar, and stir 5 minutes more. Meanwhile, bring the water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, and cinnamon stick to a simmer in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the pears, return to a simmer, then reduce the heat to medium, and continue simmering uncovered until the pears are tender, about 10 minutes. Spoon the risotto into serving bowls and place pears on top. A sweet spin off of the average risotto dish...
Preheat an oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Season inside of chicken cavity and the back generously with salt and black pepper. Squeeze lemon halves into cavity and drop squeezed peels inside. Stuff cavity with garlic cloves and fresh thyme; add a bay leaf to cavity. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into a heavy roasting pan. Place sourdough slices into pan and press slices lightly into olive oil to help coat bottom of bread. Drizzle 1 more tablespoon olive oil on top of bread slices. Place chicken on top of bread slices and tie legs together with kitchen twine. Brush outside of chicken with 1 tablespoon olive oil and season entire outside with salt. Bake chicken in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Mix creme fraiche, grated shallot, and Aleppo pepper together in a small bowl. Stir 2 tablespoons lemon juice and lemon zest into sauce. Refrigerate until needed. Lift chicken off bread slices using a tongs and flip the bread slices over (they will be very brown). Place chicken back onto the bread slices. Generously brush the outside of the chicken with creme fraiche sauce, putting enough on to drip down onto bread slices. Return chicken to oven and bake for 10 more minutes to brown the glaze. Repeat, brushing more creme fraiche sauce generously onto the chicken. More is more. Bake 10 more minutes. Remove chicken from oven and let stand for 10 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching bone, should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Pour remaining creme fraiche glaze into a small skillet, place over medium heat, and bring to a boil. Stir constantly, cooking until the shallot is cooked and sauce reduces slightly, 1 or 2 minutes. Turn off heat. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and cut bread pieces in half crosswise. Cut chicken up into 8 serving pieces (drumsticks, thighs, wings, and breasts) and serve with pieces of drippings-soaked toasted bread. Drizzle thickened creme fraiche sauce over chicken and garnish with chopped chive blossoms. This chicken is roasted on thick slices of sourdough bread and slathered with a creme fraiche glaze. It looks like a million dollars. When you combine the chicken with that sticky, drippings-soaked bread, you're talking about at least a million-dollar taste.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, cream cheese, brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, mixing well after each. Combine the flour and baking soda; stir into the sugar mixture. Mix in the chopped chocolate, coconut and walnuts. Drop by rounded tablespoons onto ungreased cookie sheets. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. A moist and delicious drop cookie.
Preheat your oven's broiler. Place red bell peppers and tomatoes on a baking sheet, and roast under the broiler for about 8 minutes, turning occasionally. This should blacken the skin and help it peel off more easily. Cool, then scrape the skins off of the tomatoes and peppers, and place them in a large bowl. Remove cores and seeds from the bell peppers. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add the jalapenos and garlic, and cook until tender, stirring frequently. Remove from heat, and transfer the garlic and jalapeno to the bowl with the tomatoes and red peppers. Using two sharp steak knives (one in each hand), cut up the tomatoes and peppers to a coarse and soupy consistency. Stir, and set sauce aside. Place the semolina in a large bowl, and stir in salt and 4 tablespoons of olive oil. Gradually add water while mixing and squeezing with your hand until the dough holds together without being sticky or dry, and molds easily with the hand. Divide into 6 pieces and form into balls. For each round, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. Roll out dough one round at a time, to no thicker than 1/4 inch. Fry in the hot skillet until dark brown spots appear on the surface, and they are crispy. Remove from the skillet, and wrap in a clean towel while preparing the remaining flat breads. To eat the bread and sauce, break off pieces of the bread, and scoop them into the sauce. It will slide off, but just keep reaching in! This traditional favorite comes from the northern mountain towns of Algeria. A humble, unleavened semolina flatbread compliments a zesty, roasted red-pepper sauce. The combination is fresh, simple and satisfying. We also like to have this with fried eggs.
In a bowl, toss avocado, tomato, onion, cilantro, jalapeno, lime juice, and salt just until combined. Cover and refrigerate. Serve with tortilla chips or sliced vegetables, if desired. Chopped jalapeno peppers provide some heat to this classic avocado salsa.
Place the potatoes into a large saucepan and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the potatoes are tender, 10 to 15 minutes. Drain off all but 2 cups of the water, then stir in the cream of onion soup, luncheon meat, milk, and Cheddar cheese. Return to a simmer over medium heat, and cook a few minutes until hot. Season to taste with red pepper flakes, salt, and pepper. This soup is a yummy mix of potatoes, cheese, and SPAM®. I hope everyone who uses this recipe gets the same great review I do!!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Blend the white sugar and shortening until light. Beat in the eggs, milk, vanilla and 1 teaspoon lemon extract. Mix until well blended. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the flour mixture to the shortening mixture. Mix until combined (the dough will be sticky). Drop spoonfuls of dough onto parchment paper lined baking sheets. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 8 to 10 minutes. Let cookies cool then frost with icing. To Make Icing: Combine the confectioners' sugar, water and lemon extract to taste. Beat until smooth and make icing thick enough to spread on cooled cookies This is a favorite cake like lemon cookie of mine given to my mother when I was only 6 yrs. old, from a wonderful lady who lived down the street from us. We have always called them 'her' Lemon Balls... she is passed on now, but this recipe is made by my mother and I every Christmas!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line a large baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place squash in a large bowl; drizzle with olive oil and toss to coat. Spread the squash in a single layer on prepared baking sheet. Season with salt and pepper. Roast squash in prepared oven for 20 minutes; turn. Continue roasting until softened, 10 to 20 minutes more. Place the chopped bacon into a heavy pot and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until brown and crisp, about 8 minutes. Remove bacon with a slotted spoon and transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Reserve the bacon drippings. Place the pot over medium heat; add the onion, pears, garlic, rosemary, and thyme and cook in the bacon drippings until onions and pears are soft, 3 to 5 minutes. Add the roasted squash and cook another 5 minutes. Add Swanson(R) Chicken Broth, nutmeg, cinnamon, and chipotle pepper; simmer on medium-low until ingredients are very soft and flavors have combined, about 10 minutes. Puree the soup in a blender or food processor in small batches. Ladle soup into serving bowls and garnish with crumbled bacon and a generous dollop of sour cream. Enjoy! Fall spices and a hint of chipotle combined with the sweetness of butternut squash and pears come together with Swanson® Chicken Broth to create a warming puree.
Into a tall glass, pour soda and grenadine over ice. Add cherry and straw. A favorite drink for little girls and party-goers alike. Some grenadines may have alcohol in it, so be sure to check for that before you make this for children.
Melt chocolate and peanut butter chips in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently, until smooth. Mix chow mein noodles and peanuts in a large mixing bowl. Pour chocolate mixture over noodles and peanuts and turn to coat. Line a baking sheet with waxed paper. Drop mixture by rounded tablespoonfuls onto prepared sheet. Refrigerate until set, about 2 hours. Chocolate, peanut butter, and chow mein noodles give this cookie a salty sweet flavor. My great-grandmother made these for Christmas every year and they were and still are a family favorite!
Mix nonfat dry milk powder, instant coffee granules, sugar, cocoa powder, pumpkin pie spice, cinnamon, and ground red pepper in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Store in an airtight lidded container or a resealable plastic  bag. Years ago I worked in a little coffee shop. We had a powdered cocoa mix with spices that was called Mexican Spiced Cocoa. On the can were directions for mixing it with espresso to get Mayan Mocha. I fell IN LOVE with that drink and have been searching for a replacement ever since. The coffee shop inside Hastings has a similar drink, but won't sell the mix to me for home use. So I researched a little, tested a little, and came up with this. To serve, stir 1/4 cup mix with 1 cup hot water and stir.
Heat half the canola oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute garlic and chile peppers in hot oil until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken to the wok. Stir half the soy sauce and half the cumin into the chicken mixture; cook just until the chicken is no longer pink in the middle, 5 to 7 minutes. Transfer mixture to a bowl, retaining some of the drippings in the skillet and return to heat. Heat remaining oil in the skillet with the retained drippings. Stir onion with the remaining soy sauce and cumin into the oil mixture; cook and stir until the onion is transparent, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes to the onion mixture; cook and stir until the tomatoes begin to soften, about 1 minute. Return chicken mixture to the wok; add green beans and vinegar. Cook and stir the mixture until the green beans are tender, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and sprinkle cilantro over the mixture; toss to mix. I put this recipe together to try and duplicate a favorite dish from a restaurant I love. It's delicious and can be made fairly healthy with white meat chicken and not too much oil! Serve over white rice and enjoy!
In a small bowl, mix rice vinegar, sesame oil, ginger, carrot, and lime juice. In a medium bowl, toss rice vinegar mixture with baby greens and mango. Sprinkle with sesame seeds to serve.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, stir together the cocoa and baking soda. Add 1/3 cup vegetable oil and  boiling water. Mix until well blended and thickened. Stir in the sugar, eggs, and remaining 1/3 cup oil. Finally, add the flour, vanilla and salt; mix just until all of the flour is absorbed. Spread evenly into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted into the cake comes out clean. Allow to cool before cutting into squares. A chewy, fudgy, brownie that is easy to make. This is great because it uses things that you may already have on hand.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the beer, 1 1/2 cups flour, pepper, garlic powder, chili powder, and seasoned salt in a large bowl. Dip the pickle slices into the beer batter, then coat them in the remaining 1 1/2 cups flour. Fry the pickles in the preheated oil until golden and crisp, about 5 minutes. This is a recipe I've been using for deep fried pickles for years now.

Pour the batter into two prepared loaf pans. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 90 minutes. Let cool for 10 minutes before removing from the pans. This bread actually tastes better after being frozen.  I make a dozen batches in   September and give them as Christmas gifts.
Fill a glass with ice cubes. Pour in vodka, then orange juice, apple juice and pineapple juice. Stir and serve. A fruity, tangy mixed drink with vodka. Be careful, it's smooth but strong.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large bowl, thoroughly mix the mayonnaise, Parmesan, artichoke, mozzarella and garlic powder. Transfer the mixture to an 8x8 inch baking dish. Bake 30 minutes, or until the surface is lightly browned and bubbly. Sprinkle with paprika and serve warm. A friend at work made this and I had to have the recipe. It's so simple to make and sooo tasty. Plenty of cheese makes this a real treat on crackers or French bread.
Beat mayonnaise, olive oil, vinegar, mustard, garlic, sugar, salt, pepper, oregano, thyme, and basil together in a bowl with a whisk until smooth. A flavorful dressing for a pasta salad. With the combination of mayo and olive oil, a light and creamy dressing is created that allows the flavor from the herbs to come through to provide a burst of flavor.

Can be made with different flavors of gelatin and pudding.
Combine milk, chia seeds, sugar, and vanilla extract in a bowl; let sit about 10 minutes. Stir the mixture, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. Top the pudding with coconut and raisins to serve. Chia seeds are a wonderful alternative source of omega-3 fats, fiber, and energy. This easy pudding is similar to tapioca. It can be served warm. Add fresh fruit for a nice twist. Use whatever dried fruit you prefer for topping.
Stir salt, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, onion powder, rosemary, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl. Place beef in a glass baking dish and coat beef on all sides with spice mixture. Cover the dish with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours. Combine vinegar, vegetable oil, crushed garlic, and Dijon mustard together in a sealable container. Cover the container and shake to blend ingredients. Remove beef from refrigerator, uncover, and let sit at room temperature for 30 minutes. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place meat on preheated grill and brush with garlic-vinegar mixture. Cook meat for 4 minutes, flip, and baste. Repeat the flip and baste process every 4 minutes until beef starts to firm and is reddish-pink and juicy in the center, 25 to 30 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 130 degrees F (54 degrees C). Let rest for at least 10 minutes before slicing. The town of Santa Maria, California, is home to one of America's most delicious barbecue specialties: black-on-the-outside, pink-on-the-inside, grilled beef tri-tip steak. The tri-tip is cut from the bottom sirloin, and if cooked properly produces a very flavorful, extremely juicy piece of beef.
Preheat grill for high heat. In a large bowl, mix together ground round, bread crumbs, lemon grass, shallot, chili peppers, and peanuts.  Season with salt and pepper.  Form into patties. If you are making these ahead of time, do not add peanuts until you are ready to grill. Lightly oil grate, and place burgers on grill.  Cook for 3 to 5 minutes per side.  Remove from grill, and sprinkle burgers with lime juice. I love Thai food, and I adore barbecue. While experimenting one day, I came up with these beauties. They might not be 'authentic' but they sure hit the spot.
Mix molasses, shortening and brown sugar in a large bowl.  Stir in flour, salt, baking soda, baking powder, and spices.  Cover and refrigerate about 4 hours or until firm.

Dissolve yeast in the water; stir in the sugar and beat in 2 1/2 cups of rice flour to make a soft sponge. Set aside in a warm place to double in bulk, about 40 minutes. Mix in 2 more cups of rice flour and 1/4 cup of shortening and place the dough on a greased work surface; knead in the remaining 1/4 cup of shortening to make a smooth dough. Cut the dough into 15 equal-sized pieces; form each piece into a ball. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion and garlic in the hot oil until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the chicken, soy sauce, 2 teaspoons of sugar, green onion, salt, and pepper. If the mixture is juicy, add cornstarch to thicken. Working on a lightly greased work surface, flatten a dough ball into a circle about 4 inches in diameter with the heel of your hand. Place about 1 tablespoon of filling into the center of the dough ball, bring the edges of the dough together at the top, and pinch and twist to seal in the filling. Place each filled dumpling onto waxed paper with the pinched seal at the bottom while you finish the rest of the dumplings.

Warming and elegant, this rich, creamy hot chocolate is topped with cinnamon whipped cream.
Mix orange juice, carrot juice, beet juice, and sugar together in a pitcher. I had this drink at a juice bar in Venezuela over 20 years ago. I was very surprised at the three ingredients in this healthful drink. Adjust the proportions to match your individual taste buds, and add sugar if you like it a little sweeter. Trust me, this sounds awful but it's really good! Use a juicer to make orange, carrot, and beet juice (all fresh, not cooked). Serve over ice.
Place the cinnamon stick, cloves, and peppercorns in a medium saucepan. Add 2 cups water. Bring to a boil, cover, and simmer for 5 minutes. Off the heat, add the tea bags and steep, covered, for 5 minutes. Remove the tea bags. Add the cider and Sweet'N Low to the spiced tea and warm over medium heat until Spiced Cider Tea is steaming hot. Divide between two mugs and serve, garnished with a long cinnamon stick, if desired. Black tea is brewed in hot spiced apple cider for this warming and delicious cold-weather drink.
In a large pot, put the chopped onion, chicken breast meat, carrots and potatoes. Add the salt and turmeric. Dissolve the tomato paste in water and add.

One of the first recipes my mother taught me when I was a teenager.
Put raisins together with rum extract and lemon juice to soak up the flavor. In a medium bowl, stir together the mashed potatoes, confectioners sugar, and cocoa. Stir in 1 1/4  cup coconut, the raisin mixture and lemon zest. Roll dough into walnut sized balls.  Roll the balls in remaining coconut. Refrigerate for two days. ENJOY! I live here in Budapest as a missionary and these coconut balls are so good they are in almost every little cake store in the city.  If you'd rather, you can substitute rum for the rum extract.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).   Slice a chicken breast in half lengthwise, leaving the halves attached on one side: opened and laid flat, the chicken breast should resemble a butterfly. Place between two sheets of plastic wrap, and pound flat. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Combine Parmesan cheese with Italian seasoning and chives, and sprinkle over chicken breasts. At one end of each breast, place 3 strips of roasted pepper.  Top with 1 tablespoon shredded cheese. Roll each breast up, starting on the side with the peppers and cheese. Insert a toothpick in each roll to prevent unrolling.  Place in prepared baking dish. Season rolls with salt and pepper to taste, and drizzle with olive oil. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes. Set oven to broil, and continue cooking for 5 to 10 minutes.  Remove from oven, slice to display the colorful filling, and serve. This is a dish to serve guests--be ready to impress! Good enough to be served at a high-priced restaurant, but easy enough to make yourself. Creamy mozzarella and roasted red peppers make the dish really special. Serve over pasta with Alfredo sauce.
Blend blueberries, yogurt, orange juice, sugar, vanilla extract, and cinnamon together in a blender on low speed for 30 seconds; increase speed to high and blend until smooth, about 2 minutes. Add ice and blend on high until smooth, about 1 minute more. A quick recipe I thought up while trying to decide what to eat for breakfast. Great if you are trying to figure out what to do with those blueberries in the fridge or freezer! Also great on-the-go!   Delicious and includes many foods that are a great way to start your day! Many of the ingredients, except for the blueberries and yogurt, are optional and vary depending on your own taste. I love cinnamon and a thick, super-cold smoothie. This recipe is super versatile, and you can change it depending on dietary needs or personal preference. Have fun with it!
Mix flour and margarine together in a saucepan over medium heat, stirring until the flour and margarine form a paste. Whisk cream into flour mixture about 1/2 cup at a time until smoothly combined; whisk in chicken broth and parsley. Bring sauce to a simmer, whisking constantly until thickened. Whisk egg yolks and lemon juice together in a bowl. Whisk egg yolk mixture slowly into cream mixture, about 1 tablespoon at a time, until the sauce barely comes to a simmer and coats the back of a spoon. Do not boil. If thicker sauce is desired, whisk cornstarch and 1/4 cup of sauce in a small bowl; stir cornstarch mixture back into sauce until thickened, about 2 minutes. Stir chicken breast pieces into sauce until chicken is heated through. This was my Grandma's secret family recipe from her French ancestors. I have never seen a recipe like this on any site. It's a rich creamy sauce over chicken...great with mashed potatoes. A great dish for Easter or Christmas.
Remove the stems, seeds, and membranes from the ancho chiles and guajillo chiles, then soak in hot water until softened, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a pot of water to a boil. Remove the stems from the tomatoes, then cut a shallow X on the bottom. Drop the tomatoes into the water, and cook uncovered until the skin begins to peel off, about 30 seconds. Drain in a colander, then immediately immerse in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process. Once the tomatoes are cold, peel the skin off. Drain chiles and transfer to a blender along with the peeled tomatoes, garlic, onion, and chicken broth. Blend until smooth. Heat 1/2 of the corn oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir in the chile mixture, then reduce heat to low and simmer for 10 minutes. Season with salt. Heat the remaining corn oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Brown the chicken legs in 2 batches and remove from the skillet. Stir the chorizo into the same skillet; cook and stir until the chorizo is evenly browned. Drain any excess oil and stir in 1 cup of the chile sauce. Return the chicken to the skillet, along with the remaining chile sauce. Bring to a simmer and continue cooking until chicken is tender, 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. This is the way Mexican cooks prepare chicken - so tender and flavorful! Looks complicated, but it is really so easy. Garnish with chopped avocado, onion, radish or cheese, if you want. You could serve this with Mexican rice and/or beans, or just some fresh fruit (mango, pineapple, papaya, etc.)
Whisk together the salad dressing, apple juice, onion flakes, dill, mustard and salt and pepper. Pour over potatoes and toss to coat. This is a super quick and easy recipe kids love. It was always a hit with both moms and kids at my playgroups and potluck luncheons. It also makes a great sidedish with hotdogs.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Mix together eggs, sugar, salt, and vanilla. Stir well.  Blend in the scalded milk. For more yellow color, add few drops yellow food coloring.

Roast in the preheated oven until cauliflower is lightly browned and softened, about 30 minutes. Transfer roasted cauliflower to a soup pot over medium heat and stir in vegetable stock and water. Bring soup to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer until cauliflower is very tender, about 30 minutes. Use an immersion blender to puree the soup in the pot; season with salt and black pepper. This is one of my husband's favorites.  The type of vegetable stock used can easily alter the flavor, so use your favorite brand. I like this soup with goldfish crackers and green salad.
In a medium bowl, beat egg whites with salt until foamy.  Gradually pour in 1/4 cup sugar, beating until stiff peaks form. Bring milk to a simmer in large saucepan over medium heat.  Drop egg white mixture in six separate mounds into simmering milk, leaving one inch between mounds.  Poach 3 to 5 minutes, turning once.  Remove meringues with slotted spoon and drain.  Remove milk from heat and set aside. Beat eggs and egg yolks in a large bowl.  Beat in 1/2 cup sugar.  Stir in milk from the saucepan. Cook milk mixture in a double boiler over simmering water, stirring constantly, until mixture thickens enough to coat the back of a metal spoon.  Let cool before stirring in vanilla. To serve, pour custard in a dish and top with poached meringues. This is a favorite dessert of everyone who tries it.
In a skillet over medium heat, combine the corn, cream, salt, sugar, pepper and butter. Whisk together the milk and flour, and stir into the corn mixture. Cook stirring over medium heat until the mixture is thickened, and corn is cooked through. Remove from heat, and stir in the Parmesan cheese until melted. Serve hot. This is NOTHING like canned creamed corn!  My husband is not a fan of corn or creamed dishes, but he thinks this is great.  Easy and quick to prepare  and is an especially delicious side dish for chicken or pork.  Everyone always asks for the recipe.
In a blender, combine banana, raspberries, orange juice and yogurt. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and serve. Excellent fruity drink on a hot day!  Was a great drink while pregnant, and can be changed in a variety of ways. Use calcium fortified orange juice if you wish.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet and spread the seeds out in an even layer. Lightly sprinkle with salt and cinnamon. Bake for about 5 minutes, then stir the seeds. Season with salt and cinnamon again. Continue baking, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes, or until seeds are toasted. This is a nice twist to pumpkin seeds. Every year I host a pumpkin carve and make this variety of pumpkin seeds, and everyone goes wild for the cinnamon flavor with the salt. Use the seasonings to taste--the amounts really depend upon how many seeds you get from your pumpkins.
Stir graham cracker crumbs and melted butter together in a bowl until moistened; press crumb mixture evenly into the bottom of a 7-inch round springform pan. Place pan in refrigerator until cold, about 20 minutes. Beat cream cheese and 6 tablespoons plus 1 teaspoon sugar together in a bowl with an electric mixer until smooth; beat in mascarpone cheese. Stir 3 tablespoons green tea powder into cheese mixture. Beat cream in a chilled glass or metal bowl with an electric mixer until soft peaks form. Fold whipped cream into cream cheese mixture. Stir gelatin into warm water in a small bowl until dissolved. Stir gelatin mixture into cream cheese mixture; pour mixture over refrigerated graham cracker crust.

Add garlic to drippings; cook 30 seconds or until fragrant. Add undrained tomatoes, tomato sauce and water; stir. Bring to a boil over high heat; stir in tortellini. Return to a boil; cover and simmer over medium-low heat 6 minutes or until tortellini is tender, stirring gently after 3 minutes. Add cream cheese; stir until completely melted. Stir in bacon and peas. Return to a boil; simmer 2 minutes. Sprinkle liberally with pepper, if desired. Seasoned tomatoes, peas and bacon combined with cheese tortellini in a creamy sauce.
Place crackers in a small, resealable plastic bag. Place the turkey and Cheddar cheese squares into a separate resealable plastic bag. Place the lettuce and tomato into a third resealable plastic bag. Serve by stacking turkey, Cheddar cheese, lettuce, and tomato on wheat crackers. A great alternative to the expensive stuff you get from the supermarket.
In the microwave or in a metal bowl over a pan of simmering water, melt evaporated milk and chocolate chips, stirring frequently until smooth. Remove from heat and stir in the crushed vanilla wafers and brandy until well blended. Roll the dough into small balls and roll the balls in chopped walnuts, then in confectioners' sugar. Store covered in the refrigerator. This is an excellent dessert to bring for the Holidays.  You can use either Brandy or Rum.  These do need some time to set up so it is best to make them the night before. If you don't care for walnuts, the balls can be rolled in confectioners' sugar or cocoa powder.
Stir black-eyed peas, diced tomatoes and green chiles, banana peppers, and balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing together in a bowl. Super simple classic dish. Keeps very well in refrigerator and flavors best when allowed to sit overnight.
In a large pot over medium heat, stir together the zucchini, apples, raisins, currants, vinegar, orange juice, orange zest, brown sugar, white sugar, cinnamon, allspice, cloves, nutmeg, and salt. Stir until the sugar has dissolved, and allow the mixture to boil. Reduce heat to low, then simmer until thickened, 2 to 3 hours. For a thicker mincemeat, stir in the bread crumbs; simmer for 5 more minutes to absorb excess liquid. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the mincemeat into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark place. I was trying to think up a creative way to use up zucchini from my mom's garden. I concocted this recipe which tastes just like regular mincemeat. I hand-chopped everything; prep time would be cut down with a food processor.
To make the marinade, stir together 1 cup yogurt, lemon juice, hot pepper sauce, and vinegar. Stir in the garlic, onion, pepper, red pepper flakes, mace, and salt. Marinate the chicken overnight in the refrigerator. Place oven rack in the top position, and turn oven on to Broil. To cook, drain the marinade from the meat, and place on a slotted broiler pan. Broil on top rack of preheated oven, turning after a few minutes, until cooked through, about 5 minutes. To assemble the schwarma, spread each pita with a tablespoon of plain yogurt, and layer with onion, tomato, and cucumber. Pile on the broiled chicken, and dress with Ranch dressing. A wrap done by Middle Eastern street vendors - the recipe is surprisingly easy, not a lot of exotic ingredients, and good.  The most difficult part is cutting the meat very thin! These can also be made with beef or lamb.
Heat oven to 350 degrees F. In large bowl, break up cookie dough. Stir or knead in flour until well blended. Shape tablespoonfuls of dough into balls; roll in pecans, pressing into dough. Place 1 inch apart on ungreased cookie sheets. Bake 12 to 16 minutes or until edges are light golden brown. Using handle of wooden spoon, make indentation in center of each cookie. Cool 1 minute; remove from cookie sheet to cooling racks. Cool completely, about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in microwavable bowl, microwave caramels and half-and-half uncovered on High 1 to 2 minutes, stirring once, until caramels are melted. Spoon about 1 teaspoon caramel into indentation of each cookie. Cool 15 minutes. Drizzle with melted chocolate; sprinkle with salt. Let stand about 15 minutes or until chocolate is set. Chocolate lovers won't be able to resist these caramel-topped cookies drizzled with melted chocolate.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9 inch pie pan. Line bottom of pie plate with cheese and crumbled bacon. Combine eggs, butter, onion, salt, flour and milk; whisk together until smooth; pour into pie pan. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, until set. Serve hot or cold. When you don't have the time to make a pastry crust, try this quick lunch idea. You may add any other goodies you like, such as ham, chicken, crab, shrimp or broccoli.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix ground beef, eggs, bread crumbs, dry soup mix, salt, and pepper together in a large bowl; add about 1/2 the can of beef broth and continue mixing until beef mixture is thoroughly moistened. Divide mixture into six portions and shape into patties. Heat a Dutch oven over medium heat. Brown patties in the hot pot, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Spoon excess grease from the pot. Stir remaining beef broth with cream of mushroom soup and dry mustard in a bowl until smooth; pour over the browned patties. Bake in preheated oven until patties are no longer pink in the center, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This is a simple and flavorful recipe for an old standby. The sauce makes wonderful gravy to serve over the meat or mashed potatoes.
Beat the egg in a measuring cup.  Add the vinegar and enough cold water to make one cup of liquid. In a large bowl combine the flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar.  Cut the lard up into small cubes, and add to the dry ingredients.  Blend with two knives, or a pastry blender, until the mixture is crumbly.  Add the liquid ingredients, mixing with a knife.  Do not use your hands as it tends to soften the lard too much.  Add additional water, if required, to make a soft ball of dough.  If the weather is warm, refrigerate your dough for 1/2 hour to chill it before rolling.  Warm dough doesn't roll as well, and requires too much flour, which makes it less flaky. This pie crust has been passed on for 3 generations.  If you're looking for great tasting pastry, this is the recipe for you. While the debate between shortening and lard continues, I recommend using lard as it makes a flakier dough. Since this recipe makes so much I often roll out some extra pie shells or freeze it in small amounts, and defrost it when I need it.  Great when you're in a rush! If necessary, use up to a 1/2 cup more water.
In a large bowl, mix the cream cheese, Cheddar cheese, blue cheese, butter, olives, green onions, garlic salt, and Worcestershire sauce. Cover, and refrigerate 30 minutes, until firm. Form the mixture into 2 balls, and roll in the walnuts to coat. This is my husband's great aunt's recipe. It's been passed down through the family for years! It's always a hit at parties! Roll in the chopped nuts of your choice.
Mix creole butter and jalapeno marinade, beer, honey, soy sauce, and Worcestershire sauce in a large cup. Fill marinade injector with beer marinade. Place pork shoulder in a baking dish; inject with marinade. Cover and marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours. Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Transfer pork to a large roasting pan and tightly cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until very tender, about 12 hours. Drain and discard about 3/4 the pork juices; shred pork. After a few years of perfecting, here is everyone's favorite (that's had it) pulled pork recipe. I will give detailed instructions on the smoking/bbq version, and a shortcut that just uses the oven.
Heat margarine in a pot over medium heat; cook and stir basil and chives until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Heat vegetable stock in a separate saucepan over medium-low heat; keep warm. Cook and stir onion, tomato, potatoes, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, cumin, paprika, salt, and black pepper into chive mixture until onion is tender, about 6 minutes. Add garlic and chickpeas; cook until garlic is fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir rice into chickpea mixture; cook and stir until rice is coated and lightly toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir warm vegetable stock, 1 cup at a time, into rice mixture, waiting until the broth is absorbed before adding next cup. Continue stirring rice and adding vegetable stock until rice is fully cooked, about 20 minutes. Rainy day, and my second attempt at risotto is a delectable success to my surprise.  Little bit of Irish, little bit of the Mediterranean, and a little bit of home makes for a great eat. This recipe is delicious vegan or non-vegan. It's a great base for additions too. Let your imagination run wild and comment back on your additions that you like.
Stir together the sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl. Rim a chilled martini glass in the cinnamon sugar mixture. Pour the vodka, schnapps, and cranberry juice into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into the rimmed martini glass, and garnish with a slice of apple to serve. This fun, festive twist on a martini has the fresh flavors of apple and cranberry. Enjoy!

Cover dish with aluminum foil and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. This recipe tastes like it took a lot of effort to prepare when, in fact, it is very, very easy.
In a medium bowl, mix the cream cheese, minced clams, hot pepper sauce, Worcestershire sauce and black pepper. Blend in  the reserved clam juice a few drops at a time, until the dip reaches the desired consistency. Minced clams are mixed with cream cheese and lightly flavored with spicy sauces. Serve this dip with chips at your next party. Don't be shellfish!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with a piece of aluminum foil and lightly grease. Peel the turnips, and cut into French fry-sized sticks, about 1/3 by 4 inches. Place into a large bowl, and toss with the vegetable oil to coat. Place the Parmesan cheese, garlic salt, paprika, onion powder in a resealable plastic bag, and shake to mix. Place the oiled turnips into the bag, and shake until evenly coated with the spices. Spread out onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until the outside is crispy, and the inside is tender, about 20 minutes. Serve immediately. My daughters and I are on a low-carb diet and were looking for something to curb our 'French fry' cravings. I've heard that turnips can be made into some great 'fries.' I experimented with it and came up with this. You can add whatever spices you'd like.
Place eggs in a saucepan with enough cold water to cover. Bring to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover pan, and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Drain, cool, and peel. Cut in half and remove yolks. Mash yolks with a fork. Slice whites into small pieces. In a large bowl, toss together the egg whites, iceberg lettuce, romaine lettuce, and leaf lettuce. Arrange the cucumber slices on top of the salad in a ring along the inside edge of the bowl. Sprinkle salad with carrots inside the cucumber ring. Sprinkle all with egg yolks. In a separate bowl, mix the French salad dressing, creamy salad dressing, and hot pepper sauce. Serve as dressing for the salad. This yummy salad goes great with my Russian Salad Dressing! Its a perfect match.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream together sugars, shortening and butter.  Mix in the eggs and mix well. Stir in flour, cream of tartar and baking soda.  Stir in vanilla and salt and stir until well blended. Roll dough into walnut sized balls.  Flatten with glass bottom dipped in sugar.  Bake for 10 minutes. Quick, easy recipe...make extras and freeze some.
Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir the bacon bits and garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in 2 or 3 handfuls of mustard greens, allow the greens to wilt, and stir in remaining greens; sprinkle with onion powder. Continue to cook and stir until the greens are bright green, wilted, and starting to become tender, 2 to 3 more minutes. Drizzle greens with fish sauce, stir to combine, and serve. A flavorful assortment of fresh mustard greens cooked with accents of bacon and garlic. A good all-season complement to any main course
Heat oil in a deep-fryer to 365 degrees F (185 degrees C). Cut potatoes into wedges or fries, and soak in a bowl with milk. Stir together the ranch dressing mix and garlic salt; place on a plate or in a bag. Drain potatoes, and roll in the seasonings to coat. Place potatoes into the deep-fryer in batches so they are not too crowded. Fry for 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Drain on paper towels, and season with leftover seasoning mixture. These simple French fries are good anytime. Coated with ranch-style seasoning, and deep-fried, they are sure to please even the toughest customers. We like to serve them with ranch dressing and bacon bits.
In a medium saucepan over medium high heat, cover the turnips and sweet potatoes with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil and cook until soft, about 15 to 20 minutes. Drain; transfer to a food processor and puree. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the ginger, margarine, sugar, and orange peel. Allow margarine to melt and mix ingredients together well. Add the puree and swirl together. Serve warm. The pairing of sweet potatoes and turnips could make a turnip lover out of all of us. Preparation time is 15 minutes. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robyn Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Place eggs and cracker crumbs in two separate shallow bowls. Mix cracker crumbs with garlic salt and pepper. Dip chicken in the eggs, then dredge in the crumb mixture to coat. Arrange coated chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Place pieces of butter around the chicken. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes, or until chicken is no longer pink and juices run clear. Chicken breasts are dipped in beaten eggs and cracker crumbs, then baked with butter. These chicken breast are really tender and moist. Excellent flavor! I never have leftovers.
Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in chicken, and cook until the pieces are no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove chicken, then stir in the red curry paste and sugar; cook and stir for 1 minute. Add the bell peppers and onion to the pan, and cook for 2 minutes. Pour in the coconut milk, return the chicken to the pan, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Cook until the onions and peppers are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in the fish sauce and serve. This is just like the Pa Nang served at our local Thai Restaurant.
Whisk together 2 tablespoons of olive oil, 3 cloves minced garlic, parsley, thyme, red wine, 1/2 teaspoon mustard powder, salt, and pepper until combined. Pour into a resealable plastic bag over the flat iron steaks. Squeeze out excess air, seal, and marinate for 1 hour at room temperature, or 4 hours in the refrigerator.

Remove peppers from water and peel blackened skin from peppers and remove seeds. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Place peppers and dates in a food processor; pulse until evenly combined. Mix pepper-date mixture, ground beef, goat cheese, 1/4 cup barbeque sauce, bread crumbs and egg together in a bowl or in a stand-mixer until evenly combined. Pour beef mixture into the prepared loaf pan. Spread 2 tablespoons barbeque sauce evenly over meat mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). This meatloaf steps above in flavor and juiciness. With the spice of the peppers, sweetness in the dates, and the tang from the goat cheese it is the perfect combination. I am sure you will love it!
Whisk together the mayonnaise, milk, white vinegar, and white sugar in a large bowl; add the cabbage and toss to coat. Chill in refrigerator at least 1 hour.

Coleslaw, fries, cheese, and meat (or no meat for you veggies) on thickly sliced Italian bread brings a taste of Pittsburgh to wherever you may be. You can substitute your favorite meat for the capicola.
Stir chicken, celery, pecans, mayonnaise, yellow onion, relish, mustard, pepper, dill, lemon juice, sugar, salt, garlic powder, and paprika in a bowl until well combined. Refrigerate at least 1 hour before serving. I'm a huge fan of chicken salad and have tried so many different variations over the years, but this one is by far my favorite. Simple, refreshing flavors and great texture make it wonderful on a sandwich or just served over a bed of lettuce!
In a gallon container combine whiskey, lemon, sugar, milk, chocolate squares and vanilla beans. Keep at room temperature for 10 days, stirring once a day. After 10 days, remove the lemon half, chocolate and vanilla beans. Insert a coffee filter into a large funnel. pour the liquid through the filter into a gallon jug. Change filter as needed.

Place orange juice, white wine, olive oil, garlic, fresh thyme and rosemary, and pepper into a blender; mix. Pour into a large, resealable plastic bag, and add the lamb. Coat meat with the marinade, squeeze out excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Remove the lamb from the refrigerator at least 30 minutes before roasting. Pat dry with a paper towel. Generously salt and pepper both sides of the meat. Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Arrange two racks in the oven - a middle rack to hold the lamb, and a lower rack to hold a roasting pan to catch the drippings. Place the empty roasting pan in the oven while the oven is preheating. Arrange meat directly on middle rack, fattiest side up so while the lamb cooks the fat will melt into the meat. Position roasting pan underneath meat to catch the drippings. Roast for 30 minutes, and then reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads between 130 to 135 degrees F (54 to 57 degrees C), about 10 to 12 minutes per pound. Remove from oven, cover loosely with foil, and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes. The marinade creates the most intense and flavorful lamb you will ever eat. This lamb is moist and has a 'softer' flavor compared to your typical rosemary-and-garlic lamb. The marinade sounds a bit different and odd, but take a chance on it. You'll experience a succulent, tender lamb in a way you never thought possible.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Coat the inside of a glass 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir beef and pork in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; drain and discard grease. Mix spaghetti sauce and brown sugar into beef-pork mixture until sauce is well blended. Combine cottage cheese, blue cheese, Parmesan cheese, egg, and oregano in a bowl. Spread enough sauce into the bottom of the loaf pan to reach 1-inch depth. Break 2 lasagna noodles to fit the length of the loaf pan, slightly overlapping. Spread 1/2 of the cheese mixture over noodle layer. Layer 3 slices provolone, slightly overlapping, over cheese layer. Sprinkle 1/2 of the Cheddar cheese over provolone cheese. Repeat layering with the remaining ingredients ending in a layer of sauce. Place the loaf pan on the prepared baking sheet and top loaf pan loosely with a piece of aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until bubbling and cooked through, about 1 1/2 hours. Let stand for 15 minutes before slicing. The blue cheese in this recipe lends a creamy quality to the cottage cheese layer and only a subtle, pleasant touch of flavor. There is no mozzarella in this non-traditional lasagna that will have your guests waiting for the recipe handout. (Have it ready!) I have the habit of making way too much lasagna, so this recipe is perfect for keeping my portions under control for our now-empty nest with minimal leftovers. I believe this would work well in a slow cooker, but haven't tried it yet. Don't be afraid of the blue cheese flavor overpowering this recipe - it doesn't!
Place the chicken and cornstarch into a bag or bowl, and toss to coat. Heat oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the chicken pieces and garlic, stirring constantly until lightly browned. Stir in the soy sauce, vinegar, sugar and water. Cover, and cook until the chicken pieces are no longer pink inside, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir in the green onion, and cayenne pepper, cook uncovered for about 2 more minutes. Serve over white rice. A simple, quick recipe for Szechuan-style chicken with basic ingredients. This is usually served over white rice.
Bring cream, 1/2 cup sugar and lemon zest to a simmer in a large saucepan over medium-low heat. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soften gelatin in 2 generous Tbs. cold water. Whisk softened gelatin and 2 Tbs. orange liqueur into cream mixture. Pour cream mixture into 8 4-ounce ramekins or custard cups that have been lightly coated with vegetable cooking spray (blot excess oil with a paper towel). Set custard cups in a shallow pan, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 4 hours, preferably overnight. Partially thaw raspberries on countertop. Place in a food processor fitted with the metal blade and add remaining 6 Tbs. sugar and 2 Tbs. orange liqueur. Transfer sauce to a medium bowl (if you want a seedless sauce, strain first through a fine-mesh sieve). Stir in fresh raspberries, and let stand about 1 hour. When ready to serve, run a thin-bladed knife around each dessert to loosen; turn onto a dessert plate to unmold. Spoon raspberry sauce around panna cotta and serve. You'll love this silky-smooth dessert.
Stir together ground nuts, cinnamon, and sugar.  Mix in melted butter. Press the mixture into the bottom and up the sides of a 9 inch, deep-dish style, pie pan.  Chill the unbaked crust in the refrigerator for about 30 to 45 minutes. Place pie crust on a cookie sheet, and position on the middle rack of a preheated 350 degree F (175 degree C) oven.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until lightly browned.  WATCH it carefully, as nut crusts burn easily; they DON'T have to turn black to taste burnt!   Cool completely before filling. This crust is especially good as a base for Eggnog Pie with Rum, but can be used with almost any custard pie.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and spray with cooking spray. Combine garlic, soy sauce, Dijon mustard, and honey in a bowl. Place salmon, skin-side down, onto the prepared baking sheet. Prick salmon several times with a fork. Spread garlic mixture over salmon; top with sesame seeds. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 10 to 20 minutes. This recipe is so easy to make for a weekday or fancy weekend meal. The little bit of honey gives the salmon a great taste even the pickiest of eaters will enjoy!  It makes anyone feel like a gourmet cook. Serve with wild rice and green beans.
Spray a 9x13 inch baking pan with vegetable spray. In a heavy 4 quart sauce pan, combine sugar, milk, and butter or margarine. Heat to a full boil, stirring constantly. Boil for 5 minutes over medium heat, stirring constantly. Remove from heat, and add peanut butter chips; stir until chips have melted. Mix in marshmallow cream and vanilla until well blended.  Pour into prepared pan. Cool. Cut into pieces and enjoy. I made this up for my niece who couldn't eat chocolate but loved peanut butter when she was about  five years old. She is now fourteen, and she still asks for it every Christmas.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil grate. While the grill is preheating, mix together eggs, garlic, feta cheese, spinach, and turkey in a large bowl until well combined; form into 8 patties. Cook on preheated grill until no longer pink in the center, 15 to 20 minutes. These are a big hit in the summertime when everyone is tired of the same old hamburgers and hot dogs. Serve with or without buns and your favorite condiments. I like to serve these with lettuce, tomato, and Tzatziki sauce (you can find recipes for that on this site as well).
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch baking dish. Mix the diced bread, onion, salt and herbs together. Combine the soup with milk, stirring until creamy. In the bottom of the prepared dish, layer half of the fish, half of the bread mixture and half of the soup mixture. Repeat layers and cover top with cracker crumbs and dot with butter. Bake uncovered in a preheated oven for 1 hour or until fish is flaky with a fork. This casserole can be changed by varying the herbs used to flavor it.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F.  In a large bowl, mix all ingredients until well blended. Drop on greased cookie sheets and bake for 12 to 15 minutes. Great recipe for when you need a lot of cookies for picnics, potlucks, family reunions, Christmas....
In a bowl, stir together the chicken broth, soy sauce, cornstarch, and garlic until the cornstarch is smooth, and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet over medium-high heat until shimmering, and cook and stir the chicken until cooked through and no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Remove from the wok and set aside. Place the snow peas into the hot wok, and cook and stir until bright green and still crisp, about 3 minutes. Stir in the mushrooms and green onions, and toss with the snow peas in the hot oil until the mushrooms are tender and have given up their juice, about 5 minutes. Pour off excess juices, if any. Return the chicken to the wok, and stir briefly over medium heat to combine with the cooked vegetables. Stir the reserved sauce ingredients to recombine, if needed, and add to the wok. Gently stir in the avocado, and let the mixture bubble until the sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir gently to coat everything in sauce, and serve. I created this recipe after trying a similar dish at a local Chinese restaurant.  The avocado tastes SO good with snow peas and chicken.  Be sure you use unripened avocados so they don't turn to mush during the cooking process! Serve over rice.
Crumble the ground beef into a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir until evenly browned. Add taco seasoning and water; simmer for 15 minutes over low heat. In a medium bowl, stir together the salsa, cream of mushroom soup and cream of chicken soup. Mix in most of the cheese, reserving 3/4 cup for later. Place a layer of  tortillas covering the bottom of a slow cooker. Scoop a layer of the ground beef over that, and then spoon a layer of the cheese mixture. Repeat the layers until you run out of stuff, ending with a layer of tortillas on the top. Top with remaining cheese. Cover, and cook on High for 45 minutes to 1 hour. An old Mexican classic with a new twist. Anytime we have a potluck, I am asked to bring these. Can be made with chicken or beef.
Place the potatoes in a large pan of water and boil over medium-low heat until tender, about 12 minutes. Drain the potatoes, and place in the refrigerator to cool. Place the eggs in a saucepan of cold water over medium heat, and bring to a full boil. Turn off the heat, cover the pan, and allow the eggs to sit in the hot water for about 15 minutes. Cool the eggs thoroughly under cold running water and shell them. Chop the cooled eggs and place them in a large salad bowl. Stir the onion, sweet pickles, and mayonnaise into the eggs, and let the mixture chill in the refrigerator at least l/2 hour to blend the flavors. Mix in the chilled chopped potatoes, and refrigerate for at least 1/2 hour. Serve cold. I have enjoyed this recipe for years, and now so do my children. The secret to this recipe is the sweet pickles. You can also trade the mayo for salad dressing.
Place the chicken in a saucepan and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce the heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken pieces are no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the mushrooms; cook and stir until the mushrooms are lightly browned and have released their liquid, about 5 minutes. Place the chicken pieces in the prepared baking dish and add the sauteed mushrooms. In a small saucepan over medium heat, combine and heat the soup, milk, Cheddar cheese and garlic powder. Remove from heat and add the white wine and mayonnaise. Pour mixture over the chicken and mushrooms. Top with slivered almonds and grated Parmesan cheese and bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour. A wonderful chicken and wine with cheese, served over wild rice.
In a covered large saucepan cook the onions, carrots, cilantro, ginger, garlic, and allspice in hot oil over medium heat for 12 to 15 minutes or until the vegetables are tender, stirring occasionally. Cool slightly. Transfer the mixture to a blender container or food processor bowl. Add 1/2 cup of the chicken broth. Cover and blend or process until nearly smooth. In the same saucepan combine pumpkin, LACTAID(R) Reduced Fat Milk, and remaining broth. Stir in the blended vegetable mixture and the 8 ounces shrimp; heat through. If desired, thread additional cooked shrimp on small skewers. Ladle soup into soup bowls. If desired, top each serving with snipped chives and a shrimp skewer. Turn a can of pumpkin into an exciting soup. Just the right blend of ginger, cilantro, allspice, and garlic gives the pumpkin and shrimp a Caribbean-style flavor.
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion, ginger, and jalapeno pepper; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 7 minutes. Add the butternut squash and chicken broth, and bring to a boil over high heat. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the squash is tender, about 30 minutes. Stir in the evaporated milk, coconut milk, sugar, salt and pepper. Cook and stir 5 minutes more. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth, and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with sour cream and thyme to serve. A great soup to warm you up in a hurry. Great any time of year. You can play with the volumes of jalapeno and ginger and sour cream, to whatever you like. You can vary the amount of sour cream you add depending on how 'hot' you want the soup to taste.
Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the green onion, celery, and prosciutto; cover the pot and cook the mixture, stirring once, for 2 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high. Stir the scallops and oysters with liquid into the green onion mixture; cook uncovered, stirring frequently, until the scallops are cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir the corn, tomato, half-and-half, jalapeno pepper, sesame oil, and cilantro into the oyster mixture. Remove the pot from heat, cover, and allow the stew to sit until uniformly heated, about 10 minutes. Season with salt and pepper to serve. If you prefer, increase the amount of scallops and eliminate the oysters. If you prefer thinner stew, add another 1/2 cup milk.
Place the beets and potatoes in separate bowls, each with enough water to cover. Set aside to soak until you need them. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Cook the lentils, mustard seed, cumin seed, and red chile peppers in the hot oil until the seeds begin to splutter, about 30 seconds. Stir the asafoetida and curry leaves into the mixture and cook another few seconds. Drain the beets and potatoes and add to the skillet. Cook and stir until they begin to brown, about 5 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and continue cooking until the potatoes and beets are soft, about 20 minutes more. If there is excess water in the pan, increase the heat to high and cook until the water evaporates completely. Stir the red pepper and coconut into the mixture and serve immediately. This is one of my favorite ways to eat beetroot. The color is so vibrant. The sweetness of the beets works great with potatoes and the spices. This is an Andhra style dry koora, so eat with rice and ghee.
Combine water and buckwheat in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until the buckwheat is firm yet tender to the bite, about 8 minutes. Rinse buckwheat under cold water and drain. Stir avocado, cherry tomatoes, lime juice, red onion, olive oil, parsley, fennel seed, cayenne pepper, and mixed pepper together in a large bowl until evenly combined. Add buckwheat groats and stir gently; top with goat cheese. A fast and easy gluten-free salad that will please everybody. I made up this recipe using whatever I had on hand and it turned out great. The texture and flavors of the ingredients complement each other from the al dente earthy buckwheat to the crisp avocado, onion, soft tomatoes, and cheese. This summery salad can be served as a side dish or appetizer anytime.
Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Arrange red bell pepper, eggplant, and onion slices on on the preheated grill; cook until red pepper is charred and eggplant and onion are tender with grill marks, 5 to 7 minutes per side. Place red pepper in a paper bag and close tightly to 'sweat', about 10 minutes; peel the charred skin off the pepper. Blend red bell pepper, eggplant, onion, olive oil, basil, oregano, lemon juice, sea salt, and black pepper in a food processor until smooth and spreadable. Stir in feta cheese. Grilled fresh veggies and herbs come together for a light spread that doubles as an add-in for grilled fish and chicken dishes. Try adding to pasta with fresh tomatoes and feta! Great served with a sauvignon blanc for warm summer nights.
Gently combine whipped topping, pineapple with a little juice, marshmallows, cherries, and pudding mix in a large bowl until mixture is fluffy and thoroughly combined. Add more marshmallows if salad isn't fluffy enough. Chill in refrigerator for 1 hour before serving. In my family, we have this every time there's any type of get-together. The large bowl is always finished off and finally I asked my great Aunt how she does it. Here's her secret!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease and flour two 9 inch cake pans. Stir together the cake flour, baking powder, salt, and super fine sugar.

Meanwhile, mix vinegar, garlic, salt, and pepper in a mixing bowl.  Drizzle in olive oil,  whisking until mixture thickens. Toss potatoes with vinegar and oil mixture and arugula. Serve at room temperature. A different and yummy potato salad; it uses no mayonnaise.  This is a nice alternative to use arugula, rather than just adding it to a green salad.
Mix together shortening and confectioner's sugar and water.  Stir in flour, salt, vanilla and almonds.  Mix well. Form dough with hands into 3 inch lengths about pencil thin. Bake on ungreased sheet in a preheated 300 degrees F oven (150 degrees C) for 20 minutes. While cookies cool, melt chocolate chips in a double boiler or in a bowl in the microwave.

In a stock pot over high heat, combine the chicken and the water. Bring to a boil, and then reduce heat to low. Simmer for 40 minutes, or until chicken is cooked and tender. Remove chicken from the pot, and allow it to cool. Strain the broth from the pot, and reserve for later. When chicken is cool, remove the meat from the bones, cut into bite size pieces, and reserve. Discard the fat and the bones. In the same stock pot over medium heat, saute the celery and onion in the oil for 5 minutes. Add the mushrooms, and cover.  Cook for 5 to 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until everything is tender. Return the broth to the stock pot, and add the partially cooked wild rice.

Freeze some of this into ice cubes to use in the drinks, so it won't be diluted!
Whisk almond milk, pumpkin puree, vanilla extract, sugar, 1 1/2 teaspoons pumpkin pie spice, and pepper together in a small saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until mixture is almost boiling; remove from heat and whisk until frothy, about 1 minute. Divide mixture between 2 mugs. Slowly pour coffee into each mug. Top with whipped cream and pinch pumpkin pie spice. I don't normally drink pumpkin spice lattes, but when I do, I make my own and don't drop 5 dollars at the corner coffee stand. And this version, with a spicy kick, actually has pumpkin in it! Cooking the pumpkin and the spices in the saucepan eliminates any raw squash flavor and makes the spices toastier. And the black pepper gives this latte a nice kick.

Stir in the condensed soup, then measure the milk using the soup can. Add mushrooms, and thyme until well blended. Mix in 3 cups of the cheese, and season with salt and pepper. Spread into baking dish. In a small bowl, mix together the bread crumbs and melted butter. Mix in remaining 1 cup cheese. Sprinkle the mixture evenly over the top of the baking dish. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until topping is crispy and golden. The taste of this casserole is reminiscent of a good Philly cheesesteak.  Even though it goes against my normal condiment rules, ketchup is a must alongside.  Not exactly low in fat, but neither is it's namesake.
In a large pot of boiling water, add the escarole and cook until it wilts (this removes the bitter taste from the greens). Remove from heat and strain the greens from the water. When cooled, squeeze out all excess liquid. In a separate pot over medium heat, bring the broth to a boil. In a separate large bowl, combine the ground beef, 1 egg, breadcrumbs, basil, parsley and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese. Mix well and form into bite-size balls. Drop the balls into the broth.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13-inch glass baking dish with cooking spray. Stir together the soup, mayonnaise, sherry, and nutmeg. Layer half of the green beans into the prepared baking dish. Spread with half of the chicken, half of the sauce, and half of the Parmesan cheese; then repeat the layers. Sprinkle the top with a little paprika. Bake in preheated oven until the Parmesan cheese has turned golden brown, and the casserole is hot, 45 to 60 minutes. Easy, elegant one-dish chicken casserole with whole green beans and sherry in a creamy sauce. All you need is a salad, some rolls and a good glass of wine!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir oats, almonds, coconut, pumpkin seeds, sunflower seeds, pecans, and salt, together in a large bowl. Stir butter and honey together in a small saucepan over low heat until the butter is fully melted. Stir vanilla extract into the melted butter. Pour butter mixture over oats mixture; stir until evenly coated. Spread the mixture onto 2 large baking sheets into single, even layers. Bake in preheated oven 10 minutes. Remove from oven and gently turn the granola. Continue baking until golden brown, about 10 minutes more. Set granola aside to cool to room temperature; transfer to a large bowl. Gently fold cranberries into the granola. A very easy-to-make granola recipe that is delicious and the best snack ever. All the girls at my office eat this with yogurt every day. It's awesome! If you don't have some of the dry ingredients, just add more of what you do have. Walnuts are a fine substitute for pecans. You can also try dried blueberries instead of or with the cranberries.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour 2 9x5 inch loaf pans. Mix flour, baking soda, baking powder, and salt in a bowl. Set aside. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the avocado and lemon juice with the last egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the milk, mixing until just incorporated. Fold in the lavender and lemon zest; mixing just enough to evenly combine. Pour the batter into prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 1 hour. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes before removing to cool completely on a wire rack. A light, refreshing loaf that tastes like summer!
About one hour before smoking, coat both sides of ribs with a little vegetable oil and sprinkle with barbecue seasoning rub. Set aside at room temperature for 1 hour. Heat charcoal or gas grill for indirect cooking at 230 to 250 degrees F. Add drained wood chips, if using. Place the ribs, meaty side down, over a drip pan and cook for 2 hours. Add about 12 coals to a charcoal grill every 45 minutes or so to maintain the heat. Remove ribs from grill. Double-wrap each rack in heavy-duty aluminum foil. Return wrapped ribs to the grill and cook for 1 1/2 to 3 hours more over indirect heat, until very tender. Add more coals as needed to maintain temperature for a charcoal grill. Meanwhile, make the sauce. Combine all ingredients in small saucepan. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat; reduce heat and simmer 15 minutes, stirring frequently. Remove ribs from grill and unwrap. Place ribs over direct heat on grill and brush with Kansas City-style barbecue sauce. Cook for about 5 minutes until the sauce is set. Turn ribs and repeat with more sauce. Barbecue-seasoned St. Louis ribs are grilled slowly over low heat and brushed with Kansas City-style barbecue sauce.
Place the cherries and sugar in the bottom of a 12 ounce glass, and mash with a spoon or muddler. Add the rum and ice. Pour in the soda, stir, and serve. Whether it's 8 p.m. or 2 a.m., this potent rum-cola cocktail can make it last call for anyone, pirate or no!
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Toss sweet potatoes and butter together in a large bowl. Whisk brown sugar, onion powder, garlic powder, chipotle chile powder, salt, and black pepper together in a small bowl; sprinkle over sweet potatoes and toss to coat. Pour potatoes in a single layer onto the prepared baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until potatoes are tender, 30 to 45 minutes. Quick and easy way to jazz-up sweet potatoes. Great blend of sweet, salty, spicy, and a flash of heat. Great with pork roast, ribs, ham, or your favorite BBQ.
Combine the flour, sugar, and baking powder in a bowl until thoroughly mixed, and stir in the bananas, vanilla extract, and water to make a smooth, sticky dough. Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). The oil should be deep enough to completely cover the panikekes while frying, or at last 3 inches deep. Scoop up a scant 1/4 cup of batter with a large spoon, and use another spoon to push it off into the oil. Fry in small batches of 4 or 5 until they float to the top and turn golden brown, about 3 minutes, then flip them to fry the other side. Remove from the fryer and let drain on paper towels. My brothers and I used to eat this when we were younger. They're a lot like doughnuts but with the added fun of topping them with your favorite toppings. After a while of not having these, I started making them on my own for my family, and I enjoy them as much today as I did back then!
Stir together the chicken, chutney, cream cheese, and curry powder. Spread onto the split croissants and serve. This simple, tasty sandwich combines the great textures of whipped cream cheese, chicken, and chutney.  Use smaller croissants to turn this into an appetizer, larger ones for a nice brunch! Enjoy!

Preheat the grill to medium-high. Blend ketchup with maple syrup, mustard, lemon juice and garlic. Brush half the sauce all over chicken. Place chicken on grill and turn heat down to medium. Grill, turning and basting twice with remaining sauce until bacon is almost crisp, about 15 minutes or until chicken is cooked through. Squeeze lemon wedges over chicken and sprinkle with chives. Remove toothpicks before serving. An ever-popular combination of bacon and chicken tastes even better with a homemade sweet and tangy glaze featuring Heinz Ketchup, real maple syrup and mustard. Serve with baked potatoes and grilled veggies for an easy weeknight dinner.
Cut the block of cheese lengthwise in half (to make thinner pieces) and then into squares or triangles. Mix eggs and milk in small bowl. Dip the cheese pieces into this mixture. Coat moistened cheese thoroughly with bread crumbs. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or freeze for 10 minutes to firm up the breaded cheese. Heat oil in shallow pan to a medium-high temperature. Make sure the oil is only 1/2 way up the cheese squares. Pan fry the squares until they are lightly browned. Flip them only once. Drain on paper towels. Fried, delicious cheese squares!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place a 9 inch cast iron skillet on the center rack. When the skillet is hot, carefully remove the skillet from the oven. Pour the canola oil into the skillet and gently swirl the pan to coat the bottom and the sides. Return the pan to the oven for ten minutes. While the oil is heating, mix together the cornmeal and salt in a medium bowl. Add the eggs and buttermilk and mix together to make a thin batter. Carefully pull out the rack with the cast iron skillet and pour the batter into the preheated skillet. Bake the corn pone until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 20 to 25 minutes. If desired, turn the oven to broil for the last few minutes of baking to brown the top. Remove the skillet from the oven and shake the pan to loosen the corn pone from the skillet. Serve the corn pone warm from the skillet or turn out onto a plate. A bona fide Southern tradition! Authentic Southern corn pone is never sweet, and is baked in a cast iron skillet. Just like Grandma used to make!
Combine the lemon juice, orange juice, and sugar in a pitcher. Stir until sugar has dissolved completely. Add the brandy, red wine, and club soda. Serve in glasses with ice. This very refreshing and light sangria is perfect for hot game days. I use 'Real Sangria' from the wine section at the local grocer. It's a dark bottle with an orange label.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x14-inch baking dish. Mix flour, garlic powder, mustard, paprika, cayenne pepper, celery salt, ground ginger, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper together in a shallow dish. Dredge pork chops in the flour mixture to coat. Reserve remaining flour mixture. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook pork chops in hot oil until browned, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to prepared baking dish, reserving any drippings in the skillet. Stir sherry, water, and brown sugar together until sugar dissolves; pour over pork chops. Bake in preheated oven until tender and no longer pink in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Move pork chops to a plate and cover with aluminum foil to keep warm. Pour liquid from baking dish into the skillet with reserved drippings. Place skillet with drippings mixture to medium-low heat. Stir cream into the drippings. Cook and stir, gradually integrating reserved flour mixture, until the mixture begins to thicken. Serve as a gravy for the pork chops. This is based on Joan MacKinnon's really great 'Spiced Pork Chop' recipe, modified based on numerous reviews from others and trial and error. This is my current favorite version for empty nesters (i.e. two servings). The gravy is optional but very tasty. It is important to use the size pan indicated so that wine sauce can spread out and evolve. I find the gravy is better if not too thick. Also use milk if you want a thinner gravy.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease 2 loaf pans. Beat sugar and cream cheese together with an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Add pumpkin puree, applesauce, eggs, and vanilla extract; beat until smooth. Stir all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, pumpkin pie spice, baking soda, baking powder, and salt into pumpkin mixture until batter is just combined. Pour batter into prepared loaf pans, filling each about 1/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the bread comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool in the pans for 15 minutes before transferring to a wire rack to cool completely. This reduced-fat version of pumpkin bread is moist and delicious. You can also add 1 cup chopped walnuts, if desired.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lay a chicken breast out flat, and sprinkle with salt and black pepper. Spread pesto sauce over the chicken breast, and roll the chicken breast in a slice of bacon, securing the roll with toothpicks. Lay the rolled chicken breast into a 9x9-inch baking dish. Repeat with remaining chicken breasts. Pour the vegetable oil over the chicken breasts. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is no longer pink inside and the bacon is crisp, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a roll should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). Chicken with pesto wrapped in bacon. My husband and even my 2-year-old daughter love this chicken! Easy to make, yet tastes like you've spent hours in the kitchen. Simply delicious!
Stir butter and 1 teaspoon sugar into the hot milk until butter is melted. When mixture is lukewarm, stir in yeast and set aside for 5 minutes. When mixture is creamy, transfer to a large mixing bowl. Mix in 2 cups of bread flour. Add 1/2 cup sugar, eggs, orange juice, orange zest, and salt and beat until combined. Add remaining flour, mixing well after each addition, until it pulls away from the sides of the bowl. Knead for about 10 minutes. Transfer dough to a greased bowl, cover with plastic wrap, and let rise until doubled, about 1 hour. If time permits, you can punch dough down, cover it, and let it rise again. Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Cut dough into 3 balls, cover with plastic wrap, and let rest for 10 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease two baking sheets or line with parchment paper. Shape each piece of dough into braided loaves or buns; place on baking sheets. Let rise until doubled, about 30 minutes. Bake until rolls or loaves are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes for individual buns, about 20 minutes for braids. Frost rolls, if desired (see Cook's Note) or sprinkle with confectioners' sugar. You can make these into braids or buns. Frost with an orange icing and sprinkle some nuts on top, if desired.
In a mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks and sugar with an electric mixer set on medium speed until pale, creamy, and starting to thicken, about 5 minutes. With clean beaters, whip the cream in a non-plastic bowl on medium speed until fluffy and the cream forms stiff peaks. Use a rubber spatula or wire whisk to fold 1/3 of the yolk mixture into the whipped cream. Gently run the spatula through the center of the bowl, then around the sides of the bowl, repeating until fully incorporated. Add the remaining yolk mixture and then the Irish cream liqueur, folding just until incorporated. In a microwave-safe bowl, heat the chocolate very gently on low power just until melted; stir to dissolve any lumps. Very gently fold the chocolate into the Irish cream mixture as before, keeping as much fluffy volume as possible. With clean beaters, beat the egg whites on medium-high speed in a non-plastic bowl to stiff peaks; gently fold the egg whites into the chocolate mixture until evenly incorporated. Spoon the mousse into individual dessert cups or glasses, and chill for 4 to 6 hours. A wonderful light (if slightly alcoholic) mousse that will be sure to end your dinner on the perfect note!

Bake at 350 F (175 degrees C) for 50 to 60 minutes or until cake springs back when touched lightly in center. Cool 1 hour in pan, then turn out onto a wire rack and cool completely. In small bowl, combine confectioners sugar and 1/4 cup cocoa. Add enough milk for desired drizzling consistency. Spoon over top of cake, allowing some to run down sides. A cake that needs no introduction, Ladies and Gentlemen, Tunnel of Fudge!
Mix together the potatoes, flour, baking powder, 3 eggs, and salt and pepper in a bowl. In another bowl, mix the ground beef, onion, garlic salt, 1 egg, and bread crumbs until well-combined. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-low heat, and drop a rounded tablespoon of potato mixture into the hot skillet. Spread and flatten the pancake out a little, and place about 2 teaspoons of beef mixture on the pancake, spreading the filling out almost to the edges of the pancake. Drop another rounded tablespoon of potato mixture on top of the beef, and spread it out to completely cover the beef. Fry until the bottom of the pancake is golden brown, about 5 minutes, then flip and fry the other side until golden, 1 to 2 more minutes. Very yummy potato pancakes with ground beef inside. So good! My hubby, who doesn't like potato pancakes, loved this! You can change it up the way you like.  Serve with sour cream. These are even good next day! 
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly grease the aluminum foil. Whisk miso paste, water, mirin, sake, and brown sugar together in a small skillet over medium heat until mixture simmers and thickens slightly, 1 to 3 minutes. Remove from heat and cool completely. Place cod fillets on prepared baking sheet. Brush fillets all over with miso mixture. Rest fillets at room temperature to quickly marinate, 15 to 20. Broil fillets in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Turn the baking sheet 180 degrees and continue broiling until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes more. Remove pin bones. This is my take on the oft requested miso-glazed, black cod, made famous by chef Nobu Matsuhisa. In addition to a taste and texture to die for, this is one of the easiest fish recipes of all time. A couple minutes to make the sauce, some brushing, a short wait, and you're broiling. By the way, I don't like to cook both sides. I like the heat to only penetrate from the top down. This makes for a lovely caramelized top, and a super juicy interior. Cooking times will vary, but simply broil the fish until the bones pull out with no effort, and the meat flakes.
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C).  Line a 9x13 inch baking dish with aluminum foil. Toss potatoes with about 1 tablespoon of melted butter until coated. Arrange in a single layer in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Remove pan from oven, and push potatoes out to the sides of the dish. Place the chicken breast halves in the dish. Stir together the remaining butter and lime juice. Brush onto chicken. Return to the oven. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the chicken is no longer pink and the juices run clear. In a small bowl, toss together the cheese, cilantro and salsa. Sprinkle over the chicken and potatoes. Return to the oven for a few minutes, until the cheese is melted. Serve with lime wedges. This is a delicious dinner recipe developed by my mom. Roasted potatoes and chicken breasts are topped off with a cheesy cilantro and salsa topping at the last minute before serving.
Cook the pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Using a mortar and pestle, mash the salt and garlic cloves together into a paste.  Warm the yogurt slightly in a sauce pan.  Remove a small amount of warmed yogurt from the pan, and stir together with the garlic paste.  Stir this mixture into the remaining yogurt Drain the pasta, and rinse in cold water.  Place in a casserole or deep serving dish, toss with 1 tablespoon butter or margarine.  Toss with half of the garlic-yogurt sauce.  Spread the remaining sauce over the pasta.  Garnish with the parsley. For a very special dish, brown the pine nuts in 2 tablespoons butter or margarine.  Pour over the parsley.  Serve immediately. This is a Middle Eastern adaptation using any pasta--fusilli, elbow macaroni, penne, shells, etc.  It is just as tasty eaten cold or warm, and is a quick fix for a hurry up meal. Sahtain!--to your health!
Preheat the oven  to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place carrots into a bowl, cover, and heat in the microwave until tender, 2 to 3 minutes. In a large bowl, stir together the eggs, mayonnaise, onion, olive oil, garlic, salt, pepper, and carrots. Mix in bread crumbs until evenly blended. Shape into 12 patties. Pour the cereal onto a plate, and dip the patties into the cereal to coat. Place the patties on a greased baking sheet. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, turning once, until golden brown. This wonderful meatless dish is quite tasty, and a great alternative to beef burgers when served on a bun with tomato and lettuce with mayo or stone ground mustard.  Good served hot or cold. We have used these as main entrees or served a smaller version as side dishes.  You may want to experiment with different spices that appeal to your family or even different vegetables such as zucchini. Cheese is another tasty add-in.
Soak Brussels sprouts in a large bowl filled with lightly salted water for about 15 minutes. Drain well. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Divide the drained Brussels sprouts evenly between jars, filling the jars about 3/4-inch from the top. Place 1 garlic clove and 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes in each jar. Bring vinegar, water, and pickling salt to a boil in a large pot over medium-high heat until the salt is dissolved, about 5 minutes. Pour the vinegar mixture into the jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot, and fill stockpot halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2-inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. Remove the jars from the stockpot and place onto a cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press the top of each lid with a finger, ensuring that the seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Store in a cool, dark area, and wait at least 3 weeks before opening. Pickled Brussels sprouts that stay crunchy and are slightly spicy.
Whisk soy sauce, oyster sauce, hoisin sauce, red wine vinegar, garlic powder, sriracha hot sauce, and ground black pepper together in a bowl until sauce is smooth. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place corn on the grill and brush with the sauce; cook for 5 minutes. Turn corn and brush the other side with sauce and cook until tender, about 5 minutes more. I made this up at a recent BBQ and it was an amazing experiment. No butter was required in this very flavorful recipe.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels, retaining grease in the skillet. Crumble bacon. Cook and stir onion in the bacon grease over medium heat until translucent, about 5 minutes. Add Brussels sprouts; cook and stir until Brussels sprouts are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Season Brussels sprouts mixture with salt and pepper. Sprinkle bacon over Brussels mixture and stir. Remove skillet from heat, transfer Brussels sprouts mixture to a serving bowl, and sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. This is a simple yet delicious recipe that takes little time to put together. It's a tasty way to incorporate a healthy, and often snubbed, vegetable into one's diet. I've been cooking Brussels sprouts this way for years. I'm not sure where I got the recipe. Using fresh Brussels sprouts is preferred naturally, but if not readily available, frozen Brussels sprouts may be used instead. If using frozen Brussels sprouts, you may have to drain any excess liquid that is rendered while cooking the sprouts.
Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Dissolve beef boullion cube in boiling water. Heat the olive oil in an oven-safe Dutch oven over high heat. Season the skirt steak on both sides with salt, and cook in the hot oil until browned on both sides, about 2 minutes per side. Pour the beef bouillon and 1/4 cup artichoke juice into the Dutch oven, then stir in the artichokes, red peppers, jalapeno peppers, carrots, capers, and horseradish. Bring to a boil, then cover, and place into the preheated oven. Bake until the meat has turned from red to light pink in the center, about 30 minutes. Remove the skirt steak from the Dutch oven, cover with foil, and keep warm. Return the Dutch oven to the stove, and simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat until the sauce has reduced to your desired consistency, about 10 minutes. Slice the skirt steak thinly, and serve with the reduced sauce. Had my first annual 'I'm getting old' Dr.'s checkup yesterday and my cholesterol was - what's the opposite of through the roof?  Through the floor?  Anyway, it was low - real low.  And I am healthy as a horse so I thought I might celebrate with a slab o' meat. 
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch pan. In a saucepan, combine 1 cup water, 3 tablespoons cocoa, 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup shortening.

Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 40 minutes or until toothpick inserted in center comes out clean. Have icing ready when cake comes out of oven. To make the icing: In a medium bowl, combine 3 tablespoons cocoa, 1 teaspoon hot water and 1/2 cup melted butter or margarine. Add confectioners sugar, pecans and milk and mix well. You can add more milk to achieve desired consistency, but too much will make cake soggy. Frost while cake is hot and icing is still soft. This is a delicious moist and light chocolate cake. Everyone that's tasted it has had to have the recipe!
In a mixing bowl, mix together potato flakes, water and salt. Allow the mixture to cool for 10 minutes. Stir in the eggs and flour. On a lightly floured surface, knead the dough until no longer sticky. Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Separate the dough into approximately 6 dumplings.

Very chewy, very chocolaty (and very yummy!) cookies.
Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the plantain slices and fry until they soften, 5 to 10 minutes. Remove from the oil and drain on paper towels. Use a tostonera (a press) to slightly mash each piece until it is about 1/2 inch thick. If you do not have a tostonera, use a mallet or place the pieces between a folded paper bag and press down with a saucer. Press all of the pieces before going onto the next step. Return the pieces to the hot skillet and fry until crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and season with garlic powder and salt while still warm. Fried plantains are cut into chips for another fantastic little appetizer from Puerto Rico. Tostones may be served with ketchup (kid's favorite) or with garlic in olive oil.
In a Dutch oven, cook the bacon over medium heat until done. Remove bacon from pan, and set aside. Drain off all but 1/4 cup of the bacon grease. Cook celery and onion in reserved bacon drippings until onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic, and continue cooking for 1 to 2 minutes. Add cubed potatoes, and toss to coat. Saute for 3 to 4 minutes. Return bacon to the pan, and add enough chicken stock to just cover the potatoes. Cover, and simmer until potatoes are tender. In a separate pan, melt butter over medium heat. Whisk in flour. Cook, stirring constantly, for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk in the heavy cream, tarragon, and cilantro. Bring the cream mixture to a boil, and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Stir the cream mixture into the potato mixture. Puree about 1/2 the soup, and return to the pan. Adjust seasonings to taste. I have made this for many whom have given it the title. This takes a bit of effort but is well worth it. Please note: for those who do not wish to use bacon, substitute 1/4 cup melted butter for the bacon grease and continue with the recipe.  (I generally serve this soup as a special treat as it is not recommended for people counting calories.)
In a 9 inch pie plate, sift flour, sugar and salt. make a well in the center and pour in oil and milk. Mix with a fork, then press into the bottom and sides of pie plate. To bake:  Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C.) Bake for 8 to 10 minutes, or until golden brown.

Spray eight 6-ounce ovenproof custard cups (such as Pyrex) with vegetable cooking spray. Set them in two 9-inch round or square baking pans. Bring 1 1/2 quarts of water to boil in a tea kettle. Heat oven to 325 degrees. Whisk butter, 1/2 cup sugar and zest until smooth. Whisk in egg yolks, then flour, until smooth. Next whisk in 1/4 cup orange juice and 2 Tbs. lemon juice, then the milk, to form a thin batter. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites with a hand mixer until foamy. Gradually add remaining 1/4 cup sugar, until the whites are stiff enough to hold a peak. Gently fold the whites into the batter until just smooth. Pour batter into each custard cup. Place pans on oven rack, then carefully pour hot water into each pan, being sure to avoid getting any water on the cakes. Bake until tops are golden brown and spring back to the touch, about 25 to 35 minutes. Remove pans from oven; let custard cups stand in the water until just warm. Place a dessert plate over each custard cup; invert cake onto plate. Mix marmalade, liqueur and remaining 2 Tbs. lemon juice. Spoon sauce over cakes. For a light, elegant dessert, your guests will love Orange Pudding Cakes. Just measure the ingredients early in the day. As the roast rests, whip up the cakes; let them bake during dinner, and serve warm.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a jellyroll pan. Arrange graham crackers side by side on the entire bottom of the jelly roll pan. In a small saucepan, cook the butter and brown sugar, stirring constantly until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to a boil and simmer for one minute. Remove from heat, stir in the vanilla, and pour the entire mixture evenly over the graham crackers. Sprinkle the pecans all over. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. After removing cookies from the oven, sprinkle with the chocolate chips. Let stand until completely cool before cutting into bars. For best results, try to cut along the perforations of the graham crackers. These cookies taste like a cross between toffee and peanut brittle--very rich.

Drizzle dressing over salad and toss to coat. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill in refrigerator 3 hours to overnight. Stir enough of the reserved artichoke marinade into the salad so it is just moistened before serving. At the last minute, I was told to bring something for a potluck at work. Not having the time to go shopping, I used whatever I had on hand and used a dressing my mother always used on her potato salad. The salad was a hit at work. Takes a little time to make but is well worth the effort.
Cut ribs into small portions of 2 or 3 bones each. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Season water a pinch each of salt, black pepper, and crushed red pepper to the water. Boil ribs in seasoned water for 20 minutes. Drain, and let the ribs sit for about a half an hour. Meanwhile, preheat an outdoor grill for high heat. Lightly coat the ribs with barbecue sauce. Cook the ribs over high heat for a 5 to 10 minutes on each side to get a nice grilled look to them. Place grilled ribs in a slow cooker. Pour remaining barbecue sauce and one bottle of beer over the ribs; this should cover at least half of the ribs. Cover, and cook on High for 3 hours. Check ribs every hour or so, and add more beer if needed to dilute sauce. Stir to get the ribs on top into the sauce. The ribs are done when the meat is falling off the bone. The ribs were cooked completely in the first process, the rest is about flavor and texture. This is an adapted family recipe. It is a lot of work, but worth the effort.  If you do not have a slow cooker, you can bake the ribs for 2 to 3 hours, covered, in the oven.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until golden brown, about 10 minutes; remove to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, reserving the drippings. Crumble the bacon.

Slowly pour the cream and 1 cup of the reserved liquid from the oysters into the paste; cook and stir until a thick gravy forms. Fold the bacon, oysters, and vegetables into the mixture; season with seafood seasoning. Pour the mixture into the prepared pie crust. Cover with the remaining crust. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. An old favorite from when Absecon Oysters were known world-wide.
Place the milk and salt in a saucepan, and set over medium heat. In a small bowl, mix together 1 1/2 tablespoons of  flour and water.

You can put the mixture in the refrigerator to speed the process. Fold the eggs into the chilled dough. Add 1 cup of flour and mix thoroughly (dough will be lumpy). Drop into simmering soups by the teaspoonful. Simmer covered for 10 minutes, remove lid, and simmer 10 minutes more. These homemade family recipe dumplings are wonderful in any type of soup, chicken or otherwise. Grandma made the best.  She never measured anything until one day a long time ago, I measured everything as she did it.
Whisk eggs in a bowl until pale yellow. Whisk buttermilk, vanilla, butter, and nutmeg into eggs until butter is reduced to small pieces.

Drop batter by 1/2 cup portions onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, about 4 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side. Repeat with remaining batter. I have used vanilla and nutmeg in my pancake recipe for 20 years. This is a variation of a recipe I found on Allrecipes when I could not find my old recipe.   My husband said these were light and fluffy pancakes the first time I made them. It must be the extra baking powder, or the butter instead of oil in the mix.   Two pancakes per serving here, but a pancake stack is three or more! We use a brand of syrup that is made without high fructose corn syrup. Syrup is important!
In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, ginger, salt, sage, cayenne pepper, and black pepper until well blended. Heat a skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Form the turkey sausage into patties, and fry until browned on both sides, and no longer pink in the center. This should take about 15 minutes. A quick and easy recipe for classic tasty breakfast sausage patties.  Great with pancakes and eggs. This recipe has a mild to moderate zing.  Increase cayenne and black pepper if you like more of a punch.  Thyme may be substituted for sage, or use both.

Using a 1 to 2 inch star cookie cutter, cut a star into the center of half of the big stars. Sprinkle colored sugar on the cookies with the center cut out if desired.  Put onto prepared cookie sheets about 1 inch apart, and bake for 6 to 8 minutes. After cookies cool completely, spread 1 teaspoon of preserves in the center of each cookie that does not have a star cut out in the middle. Place a cookie with a cut-out on top of the layer of preserves. Pack cookies in a covered tin to preserve freshness. A festive sandwich style cookie. Excellent for Christmas or New years' celebrations.
Place chicken thighs and drumsticks into a bowl and pour buttermilk over chicken. Stir to coat. Cover and marinate in refrigerator for 3 hours (or up to overnight).

Place coated chicken pieces onto a plate to rest for 5 minutes to set coating. Place coated chicken into hot oil in the skillet and bake for 30 minutes. Turn chicken over and bake until no longer pink inside and the coating is golden brown, about 20 more minutes. Place chicken pieces on a rack to drain oil before serving. Like fried chicken? Like it better cold but hate it when the yummy crust falls off? This is my  years-in-the-making  recipe that keeps the crust on, even when cold! Great for picnics!!!
Stir mayonnaise, spinach, green onion, parsley, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl until well mixed. Stupidly simple to make, and is excellent with whole rye bread or rye chips.

Drain. Combine 1/2 cup water, beans, olive oil, salt, and pepper in a skillet over medium heat; mash beans to desired consistency. This is a healthy alternative for the typical saturated fatty refried beans. Don't let the time scare you off. I soak them while I sleep and cook them during the day, so by dinner it is only 10 minutes from stove top to table. Not much longer than preparing a processed can product.
Boil chicken in a large pot of salted water. When chicken is done, remove from pot, keeping water/broth at a boil. Shred chicken and set aside.

Melt the chocolate with the 2 tablespoons cream over simmering water in the top of a double broiler or in a heat proof bowl set on top of a saucepan. Whisk the chocolate and cream until they form a smooth liquid. Take the pan off the heat, and spoon the chocolate mixture onto the graham-cracker crust. Let the chocolate cool for at least 15 minutes. Meanwhile, make the filling. Heat the milk in a heavy bottomed saucepan. When the milk is just about to boil, take the pan off of the heat. In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, eggs, and flour. Slowly add the hot milk to the bowl, whisking constantly. Then transfer the mixture to the saucepan. Whisking constantly, bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and continue whisking while it boils for 3 minutes. Take the pan off the heat, and add the 2 tablespoons whiskey. Let the filling cool for 20 minutes. Slice the bananas, and toss them with the lemon juice. Lay the banana slices on the chocolate lined crust. Pour the filling over and chill the pie for at least 2 hours. Whip one cup cream to stiff peaks, add 2 tablespoons whiskey and serve with pie.

Cut out 15 cakes with cookie cutter, twisting gently to remove. For easier cutting, cutter can be wiped clean and/or greased lightly between cuttings. Scraps can be saved for another use, such as an ice cream topping, milkshakes or a snack. Serve cakes with Dark Chocolate Ganache. For Dark Chocolate Ganache: Heat cream in 2-cup microwave-safe glass measure or small bowl on high (100%) power for 30 to 40 seconds. Slowly add morsels. Cover with plastic wrap and let stand for 5 minutes. Stir well.  Refrigerate any remaining ganache. An indulgent chocolate brownie covered in rich chocolate ganache takes dessert to a new level.

Sift flour and salt three times into a large bowl add the yeast mixture, half of the ghee and all the yogurt. Mix into a soft dough then knead on a floured surface for about 5 minutes or until dough is smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a large greased bowl, cover and let stand in a warm place for 1 1/2 hours or until the dough is doubled in size . Punch down dough then knead for 5 minutes. Divide dough into 6 pieces. Roll each piece out into 8 inch round naans. Cover an oven tray with foil and grease the foil. Brush the naan with a little of the remaining ghee and sprinkle with some of the kalonji. Cook naan one at a time under a very hot grill for about 2 minutes on each side or until puffed and just browned. This is an authentic Indian Naan recipe. I have made this many times. It goes well with Indian curry which has a lot of gravy, such as the Butter Chicken.

Bake in the preheated oven until the top is no longer shiny, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool for 1 hour before cutting. These brownies are dairy-free and egg-free which makes them vegan. They have a subtle spice flavor and are delicious. If you enjoy chai lattes you will love these! To ensure your final product is vegan, use vegan sugar. The coconut is easily omitted if you aren't a fan. Be careful not to overcook them.
Muddle sugar and mint leaves together in pitcher until leaves are well broken down. Add limes and muddle until limes are juiced. Stir rum into sugar mixture; add club soda and stir until sugar is dissolved. I have served this to people who have sworn that they dislike mojitos and they love it. I believe it is the fresh ingredients and the use of sugar, instead of simple syrup, muddled together that makes this cocktail refreshing and delicious. It takes a little bit of work but the results are well worth it. Serve over ice.
In a small bowl, whisk together soy sauce, mustard, sesame oil, ginger root, and water. A great dipping sauce for chicken.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Arrange tart shells in 2 muffin tins; line shell each with a layer of pie weights or dried beans. Bake shells in the preheated oven until edges of crusts are lightly browned and about 75% cooked, 5 to 10 minutes. Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain bacon slices on paper towels; crumble when cooled. Divide 1 cup Swiss cheese, bacon, and green onions evenly into the tart shells. Whisk eggs, milk, mustard, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Ladle egg mixture into each tart shell about 2/3 full. Top each tart with the remaining 1/4 cup Swiss cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until egg is set in the middle of each tart and shells are browned, 25 to 30 minutes. These are delicious little quiche tarts perfect for a party, shower, or just to have on hand for fast breakfasts during the week. Try substituting different fillings to suit your own taste. Any variety of cheese can be used.

Pour a big glass of milk and enjoy! Yum yum!
Grease a heavy pot or Dutch oven. Layer about 1/3 of the potatoes into the bottom of the prepared pot. Spread 1/2 of the luncheon meat on top. Sprinkle with about 1/2 of the margarine and about 1/3 of the salt. Repeat the steps once more, then layer the remaining potatoes and margarine on top. Season with salt. Pour milk over potato mixture and cover. Heat pot over medium-high heat until milk begins to bubble, then reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Another old family recipe, handed down mother to daughter. I assume it is Irish, because it was from that side of the family, and it also makes a LOT! Fortunately, it is excellent reheated (and better the next day, too!) My mother always made this with leftover holiday ham, which makes it even more economical. Can be baked in the oven (very slow!) or cooked on the stovetop (my preferred choice).

Transfer drained lamb chops to a baking dish; add onion mixture. Sprinkle rosemary over the chops. Pour beef broth and red wine into the baking dish. Cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 3 hours. Remove lamb to a serving platter. Carefully drain liquid from baking dish into a saucepan and place over medium heat. Beat cornstarch and water together in a bowl using a whisk to assure no lumps remain; stir into the liquid in the saucepan. Add Worcestershire sauce and cook until the liquid thickens into a gravy, about 5 minutes. Lamb shoulder chops are one of the most inexpensive cuts of lamb, and slow-cooking them is the best way to get that nice lamb flavor. The meat falls right off the bone with this recipe.

Lay 4 to 5 shrimp halves on basil, followed by a small amount of pork, then a small amount of noodles. Sprinkle with cilantro, mint, and top with bean sprouts. Starting at one end, roll the wrapper over once, fold both sides in toward center, and continue rolling as tightly as possible without tearing. The end result should be a roll approximately 1 to 1 1/2 inches thick. Warm hoisin sauce, peanut butter, and water in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, and immediately remove from heat. Garnish sauce with chopped peanuts, if desired, and serve with rolls for dipping. Shrimp and pork - layered with rice noodles, bean sprouts, and herbs - all rolled together in a fresh rice wrapper and served with a hoisin-peanut sauce for dipping. Great for an appetizer or lunch!

Remove pan from refrigerator 30 minutes before baking and preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake uncovered until a knife inserted into center of pan comes out clean, about 55 minutes. Let stand about 10 minutes before cutting. I make this for breakfast/brunch the day after Easter. It's a great way to use up leftover dinner rolls and cooked vegetables. Everything bakes in one pan so assembling this dish is easy.  You can substitute spinach for the asparagus and add mozzarella cheese if you wish.

Place lard and salt in a large mixing bowl. Whip with an electric mixer on high speed until fluffy. Add masa harina and beat at low speed until well mixed. Pour in reserved cooking liquid a little at a time until mixture is the consistency of soft cookie dough. Drain water from corn husks.  One at a time, flatten out each husk, with the narrow end facing you, and spread approximately 2 tablespoons masa mixture onto the top 2/3 of the husk. Spread about 1 tablespoon of meat mixture down the middle of the masa. Roll up the corn husk starting at one of the long sides. Fold the narrow end of the husk onto the rolled tamale and tie with a piece of butchers' twine. Place tamales in a steamer basket.  Steam over boiling water for approximately one hour, until masa is firm and holds its shape. Make sure steamer does not run out of water. Serve immediately, allowing each person to unwrap their own tamales. Allow any leftovers (still in husks) to cool, uncovered, in the refrigerator. These are just like the tamales my Abuelita used to make for special occasions.  This recipe makes a lot, but if you're going to go to all the trouble of making tamales from scratch, you might as well have a party! You will need butchers' twine and a large pot with a steamer basket to make these. May be frozen up to 6 months in heavy-duty resealable plastic bags. To reheat, thaw in refrigerator and then steam or microwave until heated through.
Mince the lower 2/3 of lemongrass stalk. Bruise the remaining upper portion of lemongrass stalk by hitting it with the back of a knife.

Mix carrots, tomatoes, and green onions into broth. Ladle broth over noodles; garnish with cilantro. I made this soup after trying it at a Thai noodle house in my area. I just kept playing around with ingredients until I got something similar. I have the seasonings adjusted to my liking, however there is an adjustment guide in the footnotes if you would like a slightly different flavor. This soup is also good with rice or pasta, but ramen seems to be the favorite. You can use any flavor of ramen noodles.

Thoroughly mix into the salsa. Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Place prawns in the water, and cook 3 minutes, or until flesh is opaque. Serve with the banana salsa. Extremely refreshing. I make extra salsa to keep in the fridge for a pick-me-up after a long day at uni. You can serve it on a banana leaf with lime wedges.
Cream shortening and sugar until light and fluffy.  Beat in peanut butter, egg and milk. Sift together flour, soda and salt.  Stir into creamed mixture. Place dough on floured waxed paper.  Roll into 15 x 18 inch rectangle (just pat it out and don't measure). Melt chocolate chips over hot water; cool slightly.  Spread over cookie dough. Roll up like jelly roll, rolling the long side, lifting wax paper off with each turn.  Chill about 15-20 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).

Taste the stew and add salt, if desired. Excellent in a pressure cooker! I tried it once in a slow cooker: not as flavorful. I adapted a recipe that came with my pressure cooker. It is also known as Stifado if you use pearl onions, but I didn't have any and had to use yellow onion. I have to add potatoes and carrots!

In fact, earlier generations stored their newly made pies in the snow banks outside their Quebec homes for keeping through the winter. The tradition of gathering the family to share the assembly of dozens of pies still thrives to this day. Her little grandson could not pronounce the name so he renamed them Santa pies, and the tradition continues. Serve with cornichons or gherkins and grainy Dijon mustard.

Cook until peas are tender, about 4 hours. Season to taste with salt, and serve. I serve this traditionally on New Year's Day with a pork roast, but we also enjoy it anytime we want a pot of peas! It is also delicious served over rice.
In a large pot over medium heat, combine corn, chili beans, broth and salsa.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat and stir in cooked turkey.  Season with salt and pepper.  Cover, and cook 5 to 10 minutes more, until heated through.  Stir in cilantro. In a bowl, stir together sour cream and guacamole until smooth. Ladle soup into bowls and top with guacamole mixture. My family loves Tex-Mex dishes and I love quick and convenient but healthy and interesting dishes, and this soup fits the bill in every way.  No one can believe that this hasn't simmered for a long time, as the flavors blend beautifully.  If I don't have guacamole on hand, I blend green chilies with the sour cream -- it's very adaptable.  Serve with tortilla chips!
Melt butter in a large pot over medium-high heat. Cook and stir butternut squash, sweet potato, carrot, celery, onion, and garlic in hot butter until lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Pour chicken stock and sweet bell peppers into butternut squash mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer until squash and potato are tender, about 40 minutes. Pour squash mixture into a blender no more than half full. Cover and hold lid down; pulse a few times before leaving on to blend. Puree in batches until smooth. Return pureed soup to pot and season with salt and black pepper. Lots of taste and beta carotene!

Remove chicken from oven, and top with half of the pineapple mixture. Return to oven, and cook chicken until juices run clear, about 15 minutes more. Serve with remaining pineapple mixture. I was planning on making rum chicken but didn't have any regular rum, so I came up with this pineapple-mai tai version instead. Fresh pineapple can be substituted for canned.
Remove plastic netting or twine from around the leg of lamb, if any, and open up the roast on a cutting board. Place the boned side of the roast up.  With a sharp paring knife, cut away any excess fatty areas. Use a sharp knife to cut 1/2-inch deep slits in the meat about 2 inches apart, to help the meat lie flat. Cover the meat with a sturdy piece of plastic wrap or a cut-apart food storage bag, and pound the meat with a mallet or the edge of a small plate until the roast is about 3/4 inch thick everywhere, and 10 to 14 inches square. Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sprinkle the upper side of the meat with salt and pepper, and then spread spinach leaves over the top of the roast to within 1/2 inch of the edges. Break up the goat cheese and sprinkle it evenly over the spinach, then sprinkle the pine nuts over the cheese. Roll the roast up into a tight cylinder, and tie the roast together with kitchen twine at 2 inch intervals. It's okay if a little stuffing protrudes from the sides of the roast. In a flat dish, mix together the flour, 1 tablespoon of salt, 1 tablespoon of pepper, the thyme, and the fennel seeds, and press the tied roast firmly into the flour mixture to coat all sides. Heat the sesame oil in a heavy oven-proof or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat until the oil shimmers, and sear all sides of the roast, including the ends, to a golden brown color. Lay the roast into the skillet, place into the preheated oven, and roast to your desired degree of doneness, or an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (65 degrees C) for medium, about 40 minutes. Remove from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing. Rolled leg of lamb stuffed with spinach, goat's cheese and pine nuts. Suggested: Serve with Brussels sprouts cooked in butter and fresh garlic. A scrumptious Irish cuisine that is sure to please!
Place carrots and potatoes into a large pot and cover with salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Meanwhile, melt the butter in a small saucepan over medium heat, then stir in the applesauce and brown sugar until dissolved. When the potatoes are ready, transfer to a serving bowl and mash until smooth. Then fold in the applesauce mixture and raisins. This side dish reminds me of the fall and all of the flavors that I look forward to cooking with.
Thinly slice the deer chops and brown them in a heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Transfer the meat to a slow cooker. Mix in the ketchup, water, onion, brown sugar, and dry onion soup mix. Cook on LOW for 6 hours or until tender. If you want to cook it in a roaster, bake at 350 degrees F, for 1 hour. I personally am not a big fan on wild meat BUT my husband is!  With this recipe it doesn't taste 'gamey' at all. It's very tender as well.  I even go back for seconds!
Steep the saffron in 1/2 cup boiling water. In a skillet that can be tightly covered, melt the butter over medium-high heat.  Stir in the rice and salt.  Cook, stirring constantly, until the rice begins to absorb the butter and becomes opaque, but do not brown the rice. Quickly pour in the remaining 1 1/2 cups boiling water along with the saffron water.  Cover immediately, reduce heat to low, and cook 20 minutes, or until all of the liquid is absorbed.  For best results, do not remove the lid while the rice is cooking. Indian saffron is richer, darker in its red-orange color then the Spanish or Italian, and gives a better flavor to rice. The saffron should always be steeped in hot water ahead of time and used as part of the liquid in the recipe. The following is a recipe prepared in the Indian manner.
Mix the soy sauce, 1 cup water, maple syrup, sesame oil, garlic, ginger, and pepper in a large resealable plastic bag. Set aside 1/3 cup of the mixture.

Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes. Preheat the oven broiler. Lightly grease a baking dish. Pour marinade from the bag into a saucepan, and bring to a boil. Mix in the cornstarch, and cook and stir until thickened. Place chicken in the prepared baking dish. Basting frequently with the reserved 1/3 cup marinade, broil 8 minutes per side, until juices run clear. Place chicken over the cooked rice, and top with boiled marinade to serve. Here is a great Korean Teriyaki recipe that is made with maple syrup instead of sugar. For a vegetarian version, use Chinese extra firm tofu.
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Combine the preserves, mustard and curry powder in a large skillet and heat over low heat, stirring constantly, until preserves are completely melted and smooth.

Fill a large pot with water, add oil, and bring to a boil. Place flour in a large mixing bowl and make a well in the middle.  Add salt, eggs, and water and beat the dough until smooth and bubbly.  The dough should have a thick consistency.  Fill a spaetzle press with the dough and squeeze into the boiling water (You may use a colander to push the dough through or a wooden cutting board and scrape dough little by little with a knife into the water). When the spaetzle float to the top of the pot, drain them.  Place half of the spaetzle in a glass baking dish and add a layer of sauerkraut on top.  Add another layer of spaetzle and sauerkraut.  Cover the pan to keep the dish warm. In a separate pan melt the butter and add breadcrumbs just long enough to moisten them.  Top the spaetzle with the breadcrumbs.  Serve all layers together, or reheat the next day in a little bit of butter. I am from Germany and this was one of our favorite foods to make. Homemade authentic spaetzle with sauerkraut and breadcrumbs sauteed in butter. Delicious.

Cook under the broiler until browned, 5 to 6 minutes. Flip and season with the remaining coriander seed; cook under the broiler until browned, 3 to 4 minutes. Whisk the lemon juice, basil, and salt together in a bowl; drizzle over the broiled eggplant slices. Serve warm. Eggplant without garlic? Yes, it can work - deliciously. This recipe seems to me to bring out the glorious flavor of eggplant and is wonderful for a change to other garlicky eggplant recipes. It is important not to pulverize the coriander. 
Place the pork roast into the bottom of a slow cooker. Pour the tomato sauce, sugar, soy sauce, sake, and garlic into a bowl, and stir until the sugar has dissolved.

This versatile recipe can be used for burgers or a main meat dish! Serve on burger buns with a slice of Swiss cheese or as a main dish with mushroom or brown gravy! If your family loves onions, add them into the mix along with some fresh peppercorns! Enjoy!
In a large skillet heat oil over medium heat.  Sprinkle seasoning salt on both sides of tomato slices, then dredge in the 1/2 cup of flour.  Place tomatoes in the hot oil and fry until golden brown, turning once.  Keep tomatoes warm. Add the 2 tablespoons of flour to the oil and cook over medium heat, stirring until smooth, about one minute.  Gradually pour in the half and half, stirring constantly until thickened.  Stir in the brown sugar, salt and pepper.  Spoon gravy over the tomato slices and serve immediately. This has been a standard in our house for the past 30 plus years. We have fresh tomatoes in the spring and fall.
Stir together the salt, paprika, brown sugar, file powder, thyme, dill, oregano, basil, black pepper, garlic powder, onion powder, cayenne pepper, mustard, allspice, and sage in a bowl until evenly blended. Store the rub at room temperature in an airtight container. To use: liberally coat pork butt or brisket with some of the rub, massaging it into the meat. Wrap tightly with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 24 hours. Smoke meat as you normally would. This perfectly seasoned dry rub is perfect for smoking pork butts, ribs, and beef briskets. It gets a little kick from just the right amount of cayenne pepper, plus the unique flavor of sassafras. The brown sugar creates a nice crunchy 'bark' on the outside of the meat.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Pierce the eggplant a few times with the tip of a paring knife or fork. Cook eggplant on preheated grill, turning often, until the skin is charred and the eggplant is tender, about 15 minutes. Set aside until cool enough to handle. Remove the skin from the eggplant and dice the pulp. Place into a mixing bowl, and add tomato, onion, parsley, olive oil, vinegar, and feta cheese; mix well. Refrigerate for one hour, and season to taste with salt before serving. There are different ways to make eggplant salad, a very common summer salad in my country. This is a version called 'agioritiki' named from mount Athos (Agion Oros). It's refreshing with smoky flavor and can stay refrigerated up to three days. Serve it as a salad or on top of whole-wheat bread slices.

Delicious homemade ice pops that will satisfy your craving for a root beer float!
Place the yuca into a large pot, and add water to cover. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the yuca can be pierced easily with a fork, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain, and allow to steam for several minutes until cool enough to handle. Cut the yuca into french fry-sized sticks, discarding the fibrous core. Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the yuca in batches until golden brown and crispy, about 5 minutes per batch. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain in a paper towel-lined bowl. Toss with salt to taste, and serve hot. Like French fries? Then you will love this Latino version of an American favorite! Treat yuca just like you treat potatoes. Yuca can also be used to make a scrumptious alternative to home fries for breakfast.
Preheat the oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Season the ribs with salt and pepper and place into a roasting pan that is slightly larger than the rack. In a medium bowl, stir together the sauerkraut, onion and dill; spread on top of the ribs and place around them in the roasting pan. Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until the rib meat easily pulls away from the bone. Try out this recipe for a baked rack of pork ribs with surprise ingredient, sauerkraut, which caramelizes beautifully. Easy and delicious. I get many raves when I make this for company.  The ribs just about fall off the bone because they are so tender.
Place ground beef in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble very finely and set aside. In a food processor, chop the carrots, onion and ham. Melt butter in a large saucepan over low heat.  Stir in carrot mixture and simmer for 3 to 5 minutes.  Stir in cooked beef, beef broth, tomato paste, lemon zest, bay leaves, basil and nutmeg.  Simmer over lowest heat, partially covered, for at least 2 hours, stirring occasionally. Immediately before serving, stir in cream and mix well. This sauce is very different than the other bolognese already listed.  It takes a little work, but after you make it once or twice it is really easy... and SO GOOD!  My dad used to make it for us almost every weekend, and now I make it for my family!
Combine water and sugar in a saucepan over medium-high heat; stir until sugar is dissolved. Mix strawberries into saucepan and bring to a boil; boil for 10 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until strawberries are mushy and sauce is thick, about 10 minutes. Strain liquid into a bottle and refrigerate. My nephew loves strawberry milk. This simple recipe came from an attempt to create a more natural substitute for the strawberry syrup sold in stores. I even use it in my own beverages!

Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and stir in the ground beef and onion. Cook and stir until the beef is crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir the beef into the simmering beans along with the salt, diced tomatoes, and tomato paste. Return to a simmer, and cook for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat, and allow to stand for a few minutes before serving. Many years ago, while visiting a friend in Idaho, we decided to make chili and wandered into the grocery store with a vague idea of what chili was supposed to have in it.  Several slight adjustments later, this was the result and it has become a family standard.

Transfer to bowl with the pasta and toss to combine. Season with salt and pepper to serve. Acini di pepe is a small, round, pasta perfect for soups and salads. This salad can be served hot, cold, or my favorite, room temperature. Try some different combinations of additions to make variations, such as roasted broccoli with toasted almonds; sun-dried tomatoes, wilted arugula, olives, and feta cheese; spinach; or scallions and feta cheese. Israeli couscous or orzo can be substituted for the acini de pepe.

Cover the pan and cook until onions are caramelized, stirring occasionally, about 20 minutes. Stir flour into the caramelized onions and cook for 1 minute. Pour red wine, chicken stock (see Editor's Note), Dijon mustard, and Worcestershire sauce into the onion mixture; simmer until sauce is thickened, stirring frequently, about 15 minutes. Season with salt and black pepper. Being a Brit, bangers & mash is a fairly regular staple on the household menu. I tried recipe after recipe for the perfect onion gravy to go with it, and this is by far and away the best.
Stir together 1 cup boiling water and gelatin in a bowl. Whisk in the brown sugar and cinnamon until the brown sugar is dissolved. Add the pumpkin puree and cold water; stir until mixture is smooth.

Bake in the preheated oven until top has risen and is starting to brown, about 20 minutes. Cool frittata on a wire rack until set, at least 5 minutes. This Easter breakfast frittata has been a family tradition going back many generations from Italy. You probably want to make several at a time because they are time-consuming, but well worth it! Slice as you would a pie and enjoy right away, or cover with aluminum foil and freeze in a freezer bag until needed (that's why I make 4 at a time). Serve with fruit or tomatoes.
In a large sauce pot over medium heat, bring the milk to a slow boil; be careful not to scorch.  Add dried onion and salt, if desired.  As the milk really bubbles up, turn off the heat and pour in the vinegar; wait for the milk to curdle, then pour it through a cheesecloth-lined colander.  Let cool, and enjoy! Makes about a pound of cheese.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour two 9 inch round cake pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and cocoa, set aside.

When cool frost with the following frosting recipe. To make the frosting, melt the remaining 1 cup chocolate chips with the coffee in a small saucepan over low heat. Remove pan from heat, and beat in the 3/4 cup of butter, 1 tablespoon at a time, until smooth. Set pan in a bowl of ice and beat until icing is spreadable and holds it's shape. Cool completely before frosting cake. A yummy chocolate cake with a yummy chocolate frosting.
Measure flour into a large mixing bowl. Slowly whisk in the milk. Whisk in the salt, eggs, cinnamon, vanilla extract and sugar until smooth. Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium heat. Soak bread slices in mixture until saturated. Cook bread on each side until golden brown. Serve hot. This French toast recipe is different because it uses flour. I have given it to some friends and they've all liked it better than the French toast they usually make!
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook the chicken in the hot oil until completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onion and celery to the skillet; cook and stir until the vegetables are slightly softened, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer the chicken mixture to a slow cooker. Mix in the garlic powder, cumin, bay leaf, salt, black pepper, oregano, cayenne pepper, jalapeno peppers, green chilies, chicken stock, water, and great Northern beans. Cook on Low 8 to 10 hours, or on High 4 to 5 hours. Remove the bay leaf from the mixture. Stir the sour cream and heavy cream through the chili to serve. I altered a combination of two different recipes to come up with this chili. It's kind of like a mild green chili that's white with beans.
Whisk yeast with warm water in a mixing bowl; whisk in 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, semolina flour, and 2 teaspoons rosemary until thoroughly combined. Mix in 2 1/2 cups bread flour, using a wooden spoon, until dough is too stiff and sticky to mix. Turn dough out onto a floured work surface. Knead, dusting with remaining 1/4 cup bread flour as needed, until dough is soft, smooth, and slightly elastic, 2 to 3 minutes. Drizzle dough with 1 tablespoon olive oil, spreading oil over the dough. Knead briefly, about 2 minutes, to incorporate olive oil. Repeat with 1 more tablespoon oil. Knead 2 or 3 more minutes to incorporate olive oil. Drizzle dough with 1 more tablespoon oil and knead in as before. If dough seems too sticky, knead in a little more flour. Knead until dough is soft, smooth, and elastic, 1 to 2 more minutes (7 to 8 minutes total kneading time). Drizzle 1 more tablespoon olive oil into a large bowl, place dough into bowl, and turn dough in bowl several times to coat with oil. Cover bowl with aluminum foil and let rise in a warm place until doubled, 1 to 2 hours. Coat a sheet pan lightly with 1 teaspoon olive oil. Turn dough into pan and press gently into a rough rectangular shape using your fingers, pressing out air bubbles. Cover sheet pan loosely with plastic wrap and let rest 15 to 20 minutes to relax the gluten. Drizzle 1 tablespoon more olive oil onto the dough, spread oil onto dough, and poke 3 or 4 oil-covered fingers deeply into the dough to make dimples all over the surface. Poke holes all the way down to the bottom of the pan. Fill in any spaces with holes until entire surface is covered with dimples. Let rise until nearly doubled, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 475 degrees F (245 degrees C). Sprinkle 2 teaspoons minced rosemary over top of dough. Drizzle 1 more tablespoon olive oil onto the surface of the dough and brush on very lightly to avoid moving the rosemary. Sprinkle with sea salt. Bake in the preheated oven until focaccia loaf is lightly golden brown, about 15 minutes. Brush 1 last tablespoon olive oil onto the loaf. Transfer to a rack and let cool before cutting. This is such a fun and versatile bread to make. I went with a simple but classic rosemary and sea salt topping, but a web search for focaccia will turn up more than just the definition. You'll see dozens of different and delicious toppings with which to accessorize your slab.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, combine spinach, artichoke hearts, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, white pepper, and lemon juice. Mix well, and spoon mixture into a 1 quart baking dish. Top with remaining 1/4 cup parmesan cheese. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes, or until hot and bubbly. This is a favorite at family get togethers. It's always gone in a flash! Serve with tortilla chips or petite sourdough French bread slices.
Place a pot over high heat. Drizzle in vegetable oil. Add diced onion, ground beef, and salt. Break up meat with wooden spoon into small pieces as it browns. After meat browns and releases its juices, continue stirring until the released liquid evaporates, about 4 minutes. Reduce heat to medium-high. Add garlic, chile powder, cumin, paprika, black pepper, and cinnamon. Cook and stir until mixture begins to darken, 3 or 4 minutes. Stir in beer. Add cocoa powder, oregano, cayenne, water, and tomato puree; stir well. Bring to a simmer; adjust heat to medium-low. Simmer 30 minutes. Stir in diced green pepper and pinto beans. If mixture becomes too thick, add a bit more water. Simmer until peppers are tender and flavors have blended, about 30 more minutes. Hot chili is a very underrated summer menu item. Bring a big ol' thermos of this to a picnic or other warm weather cookout, and it makes a great side to those grilled burgers and dogs. Just have some insulated cups around, and maybe some hot sauce, and you're in business. But no matter what season it is, I hope you give this beef, bean, and beer chili a try soon.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook beef, onion, soy sauce and garlic until beef is brown and juices run clear. While beef is cooking, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. Return cooked pasta to its pot over low heat; stir in milk and butter.  Stir in beef mixture until well combined.  Stir in cheese slices, one at a time, until melted.  Serve at once. Great, cheap, easy meal, perfect for college students who need to save some cash!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease an 8x11 inch baking dish. In a large bowl, mix together the ground turkey, tvp, powdered milk, and eggs until well blended. Mix in the green peppers, onion, celery and spinach. Season with black pepper and sage. Press the mixture into the prepared pan. Bake for 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until the center is firm and the juices run clear. Let stand for a few minutes before slicing into 16 slices. I threw some stuff together and made this.  It's seasoned like sausage, pretty tasty.  I make it in large batches, slice and freeze it.  It makes an easy, nutritious and satisfying breakfast.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8-inch square baking dish. Beat the baking mix, vanilla pudding mix, milk, butter, and egg together with an electric mixer in a bowl for 2 minutes; pour into the buttered dish. Chop the peaches and scatter over the mixture. Beat the cream cheese, 1/2 cup sugar, and reserved peach juice together in a bowl; pour over the peaches. Stir together the 1 tablespoon sugar and cinnamon in a small bowl; sprinkle over the cream cheese mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until set in the center, 30 to 35 minutes. My recipe card for this dessert is stained and worn, if that tells you anything. I've had more requests for a copy of this recipe than any other dish I make. It smells heavenly when it's baking and tastes even better! I almost always double the recipe because it disappears fast.
In a large bowl, combine coleslaw, seasoning salt, lemon juice, olive oil, mayonnaise and salsa. Toss well and serve. Coleslaw like you've never had it before.  You'll come back for more! A perfect accompaniment to any Mexican or Tex-Mex meal.
Place sliced cucumbers in a large bowl and sprinkle evenly with sea salt; allow liquid to drain from cucumbers, about 15 minutes. Spoon cucumbers onto sheets of paper towels; wrap paper towels around cucumbers and wring out as much liquid as possible. Mix rice vinegar, rice wine, sesame oil, honey, lemon juice, green onion, sesame seeds, walnuts, garlic, Korean red pepper powder, and ground black pepper in a bowl; add cucumbers and toss. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes. A standard, refreshing Korean side dish. Serve chilled.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Season the tilapia fillets with salt, pepper and Cajun seasoning on both sides. Arrange the seasoned fillets in a single layer in the baking dish. Place a layer of lemon slices over the fish fillets. I usually use about 2 slices on each piece so that it covers most of the surface of the fish. Bake uncovered for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. While the fish is baking, mix together the mayonnaise, sour cream, garlic powder, lemon juice and dill in a small bowl. Serve with tilapia. Baked tilapia seasoned with Cajun and citrus served with a creamy sauce of fresh dill and lemon.
In a saucepan, combine pudding mix with 1 1/2 cup milk. Cook until thick. Add rum flavoring and chopped cherries. Remove from heat. Let cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, whip the cream. Add 1/2 of the cream to the pudding mixture and fold in. Pour pudding mixture into graham cracker crust. Decorate with remaining whipped cream and then grated chocolate. The one my mom used to make many years ago.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9 inch springform pan. Combine 1 1/2 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 1/2 tablespoons white sugar, and 1 teaspoon cinnamon in a small bowl; reserve. Whisk together flour, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and baking powder in a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to beat the butter and 1 1/4 cups white sugar together in a separate large bowl. Beat until light and fluffy. Beat in eggs, one at a time. Mix in 1/3 of the flour mixture until just combined. Beat in 1/2 of the milk and another 1/3 of the flour mixture. Repeat with the remaining milk and flour. Stir in the almond extract. Gently fold pears, blueberries, and chopped almonds into the batter.  Pour into prepared pan. Sprinkle reserved sugar and cinnamon mixture over the cake batter. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean, 40 to 50 minutes. On our honeymoon, my husband and I had this delicious dessert at Al Covo in Venice.  I've tried to re-create the recipe because it was so tasty!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a spice grinder or mortar, combine kosher salt, caraway seeds, sage, fennel, coriander, and rosemary. Grind to a coarse powder. Transfer spice mixture to a bowl and stir in paprika, garlic powder, flour, and onion powder; mix in vegetable oil to make a smooth paste. Pat chicken halves dry with paper towels and tuck wing tips up behind the back. Brush spice paste onto chicken halves, coating both sides, taking care to season under wings and legs. Place chicken halves in baking dish or roasting pan with skin sides up, leaving space around chicken so halves aren't touching. Roast in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted in a thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This oven-roasted chicken is inspired by the Brathaehnchen served commonly in Bavarian Biergartens, small shops, and food carts. You can serve this chicken with many side dishes, but favorites are fried potatoes or spaetzle and a nice garden salad. Weiss beer doesn't hurt at all!
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain and rinse with cold water until pasta is chilled. Mix elbow macaroni, hard-cooked eggs, light mayonnaise, creamy salad dressing, spicy brown mustard, dry mustard, and marjoram in a large salad bowl until thoroughly combined. Stir in tomatoes. Be sure to include the juice from your cutting board. Season with salt and black pepper. Tasty macaroni salad perfect with those super-ripe summer tomatoes. I sometimes add a little water or extra mayo if not moist enough.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain, crumble and set aside. Place sausage in a large Dutch oven. Cook over medium high heat, stirring to crumble, until evenly brown. Drain. Add the bacon to the sausage along with the onions, green bell peppers, red bell peppers, mushrooms, butter, pepper, celery salt, seasoning salt, poultry seasoning, basil, garlic powder and water. Bring to a boil; cook and stir 10 to 20 minutes, until the vegetables are soft. Gradually place the bread into the mixture, thoroughly blending until all pieces are coated. Transfer to a large baking dish or two medium baking dishes. Bake in the preheated oven 40 to 60 minutes, or until the top begins to brown. This great sausage and bacon stuffing contains so many ingredients, some say it could be a meal in itself. Bake it as a side dish, or use it to stuff the bird.
Pour the water into the bottom of a large pot over medium heat. Add the onion, garlic, red pepper, and salt to the water and bring to a boil. Stir in the champagne and return the mixture to a boil. Place the lobsters in a steamer basket and lower into the pot. Steam the lobsters until they turn a bright red color, about 12 minutes. This perfect New Year's Day meal uses that leftover champagne! Serve with melted butter.
Heat the ghee in a wok over low heat. Stir in the chickpea flour and cook over low heat until the chickpea flour is toasted and the mixture smells fragrant, about 10 minutes. The mixture should be pasty, not powdery. Remove the mixture from the heat and cool slightly until it is warm, not hot. Grind the coconut, if using, in a coffee grinder until fine. Add the ground almonds, superfine sugar, ground coconut, and ground cardamom to the wok and mix thoroughly. While the mixture is warm, shape it into round balls that are about 1- to 1 1/4 inches in diameter. Store the ladoos in an airtight container and let them sit for 2 to 3 hours to cool completely. They can be eaten immediately, but taste better after several hours. Ladoos are an Indian and Pakistani sweet. I added a twist to mine and included coconut...my family loves these. They can be enjoyed at any holiday, as a treat during tea time, etc. And they're easy to make, in my opinion.
Stick blend all ingredients until well mixed. Pour into an ice filled, 16 ounce glass. Garnish with fresh nutmeg. When you awake in the morning after a few too many you may very well need to have a Ramos Fizz to get you back on your feet. Henrico C. Ramos created the Ramos Fizz in 1888 at the Imperial Cabinet Saloon in New Orleans, Louisiana. This wonderful pick me up combines all the ingredients to get you up and running again. A little hair of the dog in the form of the gin, protein from the egg white, and cream to coat the stomach.
Place asparagus and water in 8x8 inch microwave-safe dish and cover. Heat in microwave on high until tender, 6 to 7 minutes. Line a baking sheet with foil. Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source. Remove asparagus from dish and place in a single layer on the prepared baking sheet. Squeeze lemon wedge into melted butter and drizzle over asparagus. Sprinkle Parmesan cheese and ground white pepper over asparagus. Place under broiler until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. This is a tasty fresh vegetable dish ready in 15 minutes. The asparagus stays nice and green when steamed in the microwave or steamer if you prefer. The parmesan gives it a little extra flavor.
Beat together the eggs and the milk.  Dredge the chicken breasts in the flour, and then in the egg wash.  Dredge in the pistachios. Lightly fry chicken in 2 tablespoons butter or margarine over medium heat until slightly browned.  Place in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. When the meat is almost done, melt 2 tablespoons butter or margarine in a saucepan.  Saute shallots until soft.  Add cream, white wine, chicken stock, and pomegranate syrup.  Simmer for a few minutes. Place chicken on plates, and pour Athena sauce over. This is an elegant dinner for company, and not hard to do at all.  Add wild rice with this for a completely wonderful meal.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13 inch baking dish. Stir together the sugar and vegetable oil in a large bowl until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and sweet potatoes. Combine the flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt and cinnamon in a separate bowl; stir into the batter 1 cup at a time, alternating with the beer just until everything comes together. Spread the batter evenly in the prepared pan. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, or until a knife inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool completely before frosting or serving. This recipe lets you use up left-over sweet potato. The cake is very moist, so you don't really need icing. Better yet, if you have left-over sweet potatoes from Thanksgiving, freeze them, and make this cake for Christmas. The whipped sweet potatoes I use already have some butter and sugar, so I only use 1 3/4 cups of sugar in the batter, but adjust the sugar amount to your liking.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place chicken breasts skin-side up in an 11x17 inch baking dish. In a medium bowl combine soup, mushrooms with liquid, sour cream and sherry. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken. Sprinkle with paprika. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for about 1 1/4 hours, or until chicken is cooked through and tender, and juices run clear. A creamy mushroom chicken bake, with the delicate flavors of sour cream, sherry and paprika. As tender and flavorful as Paris in the Spring. Well, almost. Viva La Poulet Parisienne! Serve over a platter of hot, fluffy rice if desired.
Place beans in a saucepan and cover with 2 cups water; bring to a boil and cook for 5 minutes. Drain and discard water. Place drained beans in a clean saucepan and cover with 2 to 3 cups water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan, and simmer, adding more water as needed, until beans are soft and can be crushed between your fingers, 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Drain beans and discard water. Stir beans and sugar together in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring constantly, until sugar melts and beans form a loose, shiny paste, about 10 minutes. Immediately transfer the paste to a container to cool. Store, covered, in the refrigerator. The paste is used to hold together pastries, cakes, and other dishes that come from Japan, most commonly desserts.
In a small bowl, stir together the graham cracker crumbs, brown sugar and cinnamon. Add melted butter and mix well. Press into the bottom of an 8 or 10 inch springform pan. Chill until firm. In a medium bowl, beat together the cream cheese and  lemon juice until soft. Add whipping cream and beat with an electric mixer until batter becomes thick. Add the sugar and continue to beat until stiff. Pour into chilled crust, and top with pie filling. Chill several hours or overnight. Just before serving, remove the sides of the springform pan. This is an amazing recipe that I just threw together one day. Everyone loves it so much, it doesn't last long. This is good with any kind of canned or fresh fruit.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium heat.  Stir-fry onions, mushrooms, and green pepper until soft but not brown. Add tomatoes, stock, pepperoni ,and basil.  Cook until heated through. Sprinkle cheese over each bowl, and broil to melt. Most people frown at the title, but love it once they taste it!
Place the cherries and sugar in the bottom of a 12 ounce glass, and mash with a spoon or muddler. Add the rum and ice. Pour in the soda, stir, and serve. Whether it's 8 p.m. or 2 a.m., this potent rum-cola cocktail can make it last call for anyone, pirate or no!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Spread shredded cheese in the bottom of pie crust. In a large bowl, combine eggs, cream and milk. Season with hot sauce, salt, pepper and paprika.  Pour filling over shredded cheese in the pie crust. Bake in the preheated oven for 40 to 50 minutes, or until golden brown. Cool 10 minutes before serving. A rich savory custard pie made with cheddar cheese, similar to quiche.
Pour the water into the pan of a bread machine, then sprinkle in the yeast and sugar. Let the mixture sit in the bread machine until a creamy foam forms on top of the water, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle in the salt, then add olive oil, thyme, garlic powder, rosemary, and flour. Set the machine for light crust setting, and start the machine. Mouth-watering and easy to adjust to your personal tastes. Bakes up light and spongy. No eggs, milk or butter. My toddlers all want 2nds and 3rds of this when I make it!
In a mixer, beat corn syrup, butter, vanilla, peanut butter and salt until smooth.  Beat in confectioners' sugar a little at a time until fully incorporated and mixture forms a thick dough.  Press into a 9x9 inch pan.  Chill in refrigerator. In a medium saucepan over low heat, melt caramels.  Stir in peanuts.  Pour over chilled layer and return to refrigerator until firm, 15 to 30 minutes. In a small saucepan over low heat, melt chocolate chips.  Cut chilled mixture into bars and dip in melted chocolate with a fork.  Let cool on waxed paper at room temperature, or for 30 minutes in the refrigerator. Just like the real ones!

Heat honey, butter, and remaining 1/4 teaspoon salt together in a saucepan over medium heat; stir pecans into the honey mixture. Remove saucepan from heat and add spice mixture. Toss to evenly coat pecans. Spread coated pecans in an even layer on the prepared baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until pecans are dry and toasted, about 40 minutes. Remove from oven and cool completely. Separate pecans. These pecans are a standard nibble at our house during the holiday season. Pecans can be made 1 week ahead. Store in an airtight container at room temperature.
Heat ghee in a skillet over medium heat.  Fry the onions, coriander, cumin, and cayenne pepper until the onions are soft.  Stir in the curry paste and set aside. In a separate skillet, melt the butter over medium-low heat.  Pour in the eggs; cook and stir until eggs are set.  Mix in the onion mixture and serve garnished with fresh cilantro. The Nepalese version of scrambled eggs: fried red onions, exotic spices and fresh coriander combined with fluffy scrambled eggs. Served on toast these eggs make a great breakfast treat.
Bring rice, water, milk, raisins, and margarine to a boil in a saucepan over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally.  Reduce heat to low, cover, and cook until liquid has absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.  Mix together cinnamon and sugar, sprinkle over rice to serve. Simple, yet easy rice recipe. My family doesn't like plain rice, so we had to come up with something different.
Place flour, white sugar, salt, and yeast into the bowl of a stand mixer. In a bowl, whisk together egg, melted butter, warm milk, and vanilla extract; pour into the flour mixture. Using dough hook attachment, mix on low until the flour is moistened and a dough forms, then increase speed to medium, and continue kneading until smooth and elastic, 4 to 5 minutes. Place dough into a greased bowl, cover, and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 1/2 hours. Punch down dough, turn out onto a floured work surface, and divide into 2 equal pieces. Roll each piece into a 1/3 inch thick rectangle. Brush each square with melted butter. Mix together cinnamon and brown sugar in a small bowl, then sprinkle evenly over the two rectangles. Roll each firmly into a log, pinch the ends closed, and tuck them underneath. Place each into a greased, glass loaf pan. Cover, and allow to rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Brush the tops of the loaves with melted butter, then bake in preheated oven until loaves are golden brown, and sound hollow when tapped, about 30 minutes. My husband's aunt passed along this super-easy recipe for this Hungarian sweet bread, and I made a couple of revisions to my family's taste.  Cinnamon, poppy seed, or walnuts are a traditional filling.  Her recipe is for cinnamon, but one of my favorite ways is to break from tradition and use a cocoa/sugar/butter/vanilla mixture.  It's delicious, especially when the leftovers are toasted and buttered!
In a medium bowl, mix the avocados, shallots, garlic and taco sauce. Allow the mixture to sit at least 15 minutes before serving. An easy and flexible guacamole recipe that gets raves! Adjust the garlic and taco sauce to taste.
Combine flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a large bowl. Use fingers or a pastry cutter to press in butter or margarine, like a pie crust.  When mixture looks fine and crumbly, add raisins and caraway seeds.  Mix together and then add eggs, buttermilk, and sour cream. If mixture is not moist, add milk. Pour into two greased and lightly floured loaf pans or a frying pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 45 to 60 minutes, or until a toothpick inserted in the bread comes out clean. Bread when eaten warm and topped with butter can't be beat.  The sour cream is not necessary, but makes a better texture bread.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toss the bread cubes with the cream and soy milk in a large bowl until the liquid has been absorbed; set aside. Beat the eggs in a separate bowl; whisk in the pumpkin puree, brown sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, and salt. Pour the pumpkin mixture and raisins over the bread cubes. Toss gently until evenly combined. Refrigerate 30 to 60 minutes. Divide the mixture between 8 6-ounce ramekins. Bake in the preheated oven until the pudding has firmed and the top has turned golden brown, about 1 hour. Remove from the oven and allow to stand 30 minutes before serving. A new Thanksgiving favorite. Dust with powdered sugar or if desired top with whipped cream.
Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Prepare a large bowl of ice-cold water. Drop squash blossoms into the boiling water until slightly wilted, 30 to 45 seconds; transfer immediately into the cold water to chill. Remove to paper towels to drain. Mix goat cheese, egg yolk, Gruyere cheese, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a bowl; stir until smooth. Spoon filling into a heavy, resealable 1-quart plastic bag, squeeze out the air, and seal the bag. Cut a small corner off the bag. Gently insert the cut corner of the bag all the way to the bottom of the open end of a blossom and pipe about 1 tablespoon of filling inside. Pick up petals and drape them up over the filling, covering filling completely. Fold any excess petals over the top of the filled blossom to keep them out of the way. Refrigerate filled squash blossoms until cheese is set and firm, at least 30 minutes. Combine self-rising flour and cornstarch in a mixing bowl; whisk in ice-cold water, a little at a time, until batter is smooth and has the thickness of pancake batter. Pour vegetable oil to a depth of 1 inch into a heavy skillet (such as a cast iron pan) and place over medium heat. Heat oil until a thermometer placed into the oil, not touching the bottom, reads 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). A drop of batter carefully dripped into the oil should sizzle immediately. Remove squash blossoms from refrigerator and dust lightly with all-purpose flour on all sides. Shake off excess flour and dip blossoms in batter. Let excess batter drip off. Gently lay coated squash blossoms in the hot oil on their sides; cook about 6 at a time until pale golden brown, 1 minute on the first side and 30 seconds to 1 minute on the remaining sides. Let cool slightly before serving. If you have a garden and you planted zucchini, you will have an abundance of squash blossoms. These are just amazing, with that tangy goat cheese filling and that batter: so simple, light, and crisp.
Cream butter or margarine.  Add part of the sugar gradually, blending after each addition.  Add remaining sugar, alternately with egg white, then with cream, beating after each addition until smooth.  Stir in vanilla and salt.  Divide into different bowls if you wish to make different colours, and tint delicately with colouring.  Keep frosting covered to avoid crusting.  If necessary, one or two drops of cream or milk may be added to maintain consistency Here is a great recipe to put into your cake decorator attachments for making letters, borders, flowers, etc.  Great for using on birthday cakes. Use any color food coloring.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Add the asparagus, cover, and steam until bright green but still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Remove asparagus and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, dry mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth and well combined. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer the bread slices into the bottom of the dish, cutting and fitting extra slices as needed to fill spaces. Sprinkle 1 cup of Cheddar cheese over the bread, followed by the diced onion. Arrange asparagus spears and red bell pepper in a layer over the onion.

Bring the mixture to a boil for 1 full minute before removing from heat; pour over the meatballs in the slow cooker. Add the pineapple chunks and green bell pepper to the slow cooker. Cook the mixture in the slow cooker on Low until the flavors are thoroughly combined, 3 to 4 hours. These sweet and sour meatballs are always a hit at parties. My mom sometimes takes shortcuts and uses pre-made meatballs from a bag, which, after spending a few hours in the slow cooker, taste fine. I like these best when they are made completely from scratch! Ground turkey works too, but doesn't hold its shape as well. To turn into a meal, heat rice to serve with the dish. The serving size refers to this dish as a main meal, but when served as an hors d'oeuvre, easily can feed 10 to 13 people. Sometimes I do not add the cornstarch into the sauce, and just allow it to boil for a bit longer, but the cornstarch really does yield the best result.
Fill 1/2 a pint glass with pale ale. Slowly fill the remainder of the glass with stout, pouring it slowly over the back side of a spoon to layer it on top. The two-toned cocktail includes two great beers--a pale ale and a stout--for the best of both beer worlds.

Cook the mashed shallot and garlic in the hot oil for 1 minute. Stir in the mustard and cream. Reduce the heat to medium-low and add the Brussels sprouts and beans. Toss to coat and season with salt and pepper. Continue cooking until heated through. Serve the kielbasa over the Brussels sprouts and beans. Any German can tell you that wurst and cabbage go hand in hand. Any Spaniard will say the same of chorizo and beans. But it takes a special, international inclination to make the case for kielbasa with Brussels sprouts, white beans, and mustard. I'll tell you that it works wonderfully! The saltiness of the pork combined with the bitter, gentle crunch of the Brussels sprouts and mildness of the beans is well-balanced perfection. Plus, it's cheap, easy, and looks good on a plate!

Cool brownies in the pan over a wire rack before cutting into squares. Cover tightly with plastic wrap to store. After many tries, I've finally developed a really fudge-y, chewy brownie recipe. Several people in my office are on diets and swear by these. You can use low fat or nonfat yogurt and egg replacers to make it even lower in fat and cholesterol, but the full fat yogurt really adds to the texture of the brownies.

By being topped with a melty mixture of VELVEETA and RO*TEL Diced Tomatoes & Green Chilies.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Make a lengthwise cut in each pork tenderloin about 3/4 of the way through. Open each tenderloin, creating a rectangular shape, and place each between two sheets of plastic wrap. Pound each tenderloin into a thin rectangle, about 1/2 to 1/2-inch thick. Remove the plastic wrap, and season each tenderloin to taste with salt and pepper on both sides. Spread tapenade on 2/3 of each tenderloin sheet, leaving about 1/2 inch of space on the edges. Sprinkle blue cheese and thyme over the tapenade. Starting from the side with the stuffing, roll the meat firmly towards the side without stuffing, being careful not to roll so tightly that you squeeze the stuffing out. Use toothpicks or butcher's twine to secure each roll. Heat 3 tablespoons canola oil in a large, ovenproof skillet over medium-high heat until it begins to smoke. Lightly dredge each tenderloin roll in flour, and shake off excess. Sear the tenderloins in hot oil until golden brown on all sides, about 6 minutes. Roast in preheated oven to an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C), 20 to 22 minutes. Remove the pork from the skillet, and set aside to rest in a warm place. Return skillet to stove over medium-high heat. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon canola oil, then stir in shallots and cook until translucent, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour in white wine, and boil until reduced by half, scraping the caramelized bits off of the bottom of the pan. Whisk in the Dijon mustard, honey, and lemon juice until smooth. Remove pan from the heat, and rapidly whisk in butter cubes until dissolved. Stir in minced parsley, and season to taste with salt and pepper. To serve, remove toothpicks or twine from the pork, and slice into 1/2-inch medallions. Serve the pork slices ladled with sauce. This one pan dish is actually fairly easy to make and has a French and Mediterranean feel to it. Any store bought olive tapenade will do, but for the blue cheese, I recommend the famous Maytag blue, from Iowa.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cake mix, dry pudding mix, water, egg whites and oil in large bowl with electric mixer on low speed until moistened. (Batter will be thick.)

Cool in pans 10 minutes; remove to wire racks. Cool completely. Meanwhile, beat sugar, cream cheese, butter and juice with electric mixer on low speed until well blended. Frost cupcakes. Light, lemony cupcakes are frosted with a fresh-tasting icing made with cream cheese.
In a medium bowl, combine the avocados, apple and raisins. Drizzle with honey, and sprinkle with sunflower seeds. This is a good salad made with avocado and apple that is unexpected but delicious.

Pour warm water into the pan of bread machine and stir honey into warm water until dissolved. Add yeast to the mixture and let stand until yeast begins to foam, about 10 minutes. Add flour, olive oil, and salt to the bread pan in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select soft setting if machine has that option; otherwise select regular setting and start the machine. Let finished bread cool before slicing. I played around with basic white bread recipes quite a bit and finally have come up with the perfect soft, fluffy, white bread with air pockets. Maybe a little too soft to slice right away. But if you let it cool a bit, it shouldn't be a problem.  Toasted with a little butter and jam, it is a slice of heaven!

An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Garnish pork chops with cored apple, green onion, and red grapes. It was too rainy to grill so I prepared a baked version using boneless center-cut pork chops. I breaded the chops and added a baked apple garnish for flair. We were very pleased by the outcome. I used the fat line as marker for making the cuts for the stuffing. We like our pork well done so cooking time may vary according to your tastes.

Use a tostonera (a press) to slightly mash each piece until it is about 1/2 inch thick. If you do not have a tostonera, use a mallet or place the pieces between a folded paper bag and press down with a saucer. Press all of the pieces before going onto the next step. Return the pieces to the hot skillet and fry until crispy, about 3 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and season with garlic powder and salt while still warm. Fried plantains are cut into chips for another fantastic little appetizer from Puerto Rico. Tostones may be served with ketchup (kid's favorite) or with garlic in olive oil.

Place the warm water, salt, sugar, margarine, egg, bread flour, and yeast in the pan of a bread machine in that order, set the machine to the dough setting, and start the machine. When the dough cycle of the machine is finished, place the dough on a floured surface. Divide the dough into 3 pieces, and roll them into ropes about the thickness of your thumb and about 12 inches long. Ropes should be fatter in the middle and thinner at the ends. Pinch 3 ropes together at the top and braid them. Starting with the strand to the right, move it to the left over the middle strand (that strand becomes the new middle strand.) Take the strand farthest to the left, and move it over the new middle strand. Continue braiding, alternating sides each time, until the loaf is braided, and pinch the ends together and fold them underneath for a neat look. Grease a baking sheet, or line with parchment paper, and place the braided challah on the prepared sheet. Cover the loaf with a plastic bag to prevent drying out, and let rise in a warm place until doubled in bulk, about 1 hour. Preheat  oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

She often gets into things she is not supposed to, despite extreme effort on my part to shield her. She has eaten flour, tea, coffee grounds - you name it!  When she does this, it makes her sick, so I feed her this for a couple of days, until her stomach settles. It is easy on the stomach, but nutritious and filling. If ever your pet is feeling a little under the weather, I recommend this.
Spread refried beans evenly on a medium sized serving platter. If the beans are watery, chill for 20 to 30 minutes. Peel the avocados and remove the pits.

After trying the most wonderful potato soup at a local market I tried to come home and duplicate it. It didn't turn out exactly the way I wanted but I found my version better. I got the name Potato Chowder soup because when my husband tried it he thought it tasted like a chowder. Also a can of corn could be added as a quick variation. Very tasty and warms the soul on a dreary damp day.

Grill the chops until they are browned, show good grill marks, and the meat is no longer pink inside, about 4 minutes per side.  An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Very simple and oh, so good!  Best of all, can be made from ingredients you probably already have in your pantry.  My favorite way to do pork chops.  Hope you enjoy this recipe as much as I do.

Cut cooled beets into 1/2-inch cubes. Measure 1/2 cup of beet cubes and reserve remainder for later use. Stir beets into yogurt in a bowl; season with salt. This beet yogurt has an amazing color with a wonderful taste. I like beet yogurt as a side or by cooking beets a little sweeter as a dessert.  This is called 'Mast-o-laboo' in Persian cuisine.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cream shortening and sugar.  Add eggs, sour milk and vanilla.   Add dry ingredients and mix well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes.

Bring the mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and allow to simmer for 1 to 2 minutes. Whisk together the remaining milk and the flour until smooth, and whisk the milk mixture into the hot stock mixture. Keep whisking continuously to avoid lumps until the soup comes almost to a boil and thickens. I stopped using canned foods, so this is my alternative. This makes about 2 cans worth, and is perfect for casseroles!
In a large bowl, toss together baby spinach, blackberries, feta cheese, cherry tomatoes, green onion, and walnuts. Garnish with edible flowers.

Spread the pea mixture evenly across the bottom of the dish. Spread the lettuce in an even layer over the pea mixture, and top the lettuce with a layer of the Cheddar cheese.  Sprinkle bacon bits over the cheese. Chill for at least 8 hours or overnight to blend flavors. This delightful layered salad is filling and fresh at the same time. It is so versatile that it works for any time of the year--July 4th or Christmas. It's one of the better ways I get my kids to 'eat their peas'! 
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F. Grate zest from lemon; set aside. Squeeze 1 tablespoon lemon juice into a small bowl. Add honey and mix well. Line a baking sheet with foil; spray foil with cooking spray. Place salmon fillets on baking sheet. Generously season with black pepper. Drizzle with half of the honey mixture. Roast salmon for 10 to 12 minutes or until fish is lightly browned and flakes easily. Brush on remaining glaze as needed. For a browner glaze, broil on HIGH the last few minutes of cooking. Heat oil in a large nonstick skillet over medium-high heat. Add onions and garlic and saute 3 to 5 minutes. Add spinach and white wine. Continue to saute until spinach is wilted and most of the liquid has evaporated. Stir in 1 teaspoon lemon zest, crushed red pepper and salt. Divide spinach evenly on top of salmon fillets; sprinkle with pine nuts. Serve immediately. Full of fresh flavors.

Cook, stirring constantly, until the sauce thickens enough to coat a metal spoon. Season with salt and white pepper, remove from the heat and set aside to cool. When the sauce is cooled, stir in the feta cheese, egg yolks, Monterey jack cheese, 3 tablespoons melted butter and parsley. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut the sheets of phyllo dough into strips about 3 inches wide. Use one stack at a time, covering the rest with a damp towel to keep them from drying out. Lay out one piece of phyllo at a time. Brush with butter, and place about 1 teaspoon of the cheese mixture on one end. Fold one corner up to match the other edge. Continue folding in triangle shape until you reach the end of the strip. Place on a baking sheet, and continue with the remaining strips of dough. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or until golden brown. These can also be prepared ahead of time, and frozen after folding. Bake when ready to serve. Straight from Athens! Feta and Monterey Jack cheeses are mixed into a sauce with parsley and used to fill phyllo triangles in this delicious Greek appetizer.
Press raspberries through a fine-mesh sieve using a spoon to remove seeds. Whisk raspberries, rice vinegar, garlic, sugar, sea salt, and white pepper together in a bowl. Slowly drizzle avocado oil into raspberry mixture, whisking rapidly, until dressing is thick and creamy. Let sit until flavors develop, about 10 minutes. This is an easy and delicious homemade salad dressing. Keeps for a day in the refrigerator. Great on a salad of spinach leaves, red onion, cherry tomatoes, and toasted sliced almonds.
Adjust oven rack to lower-middle position and heat oven to 375 degrees. Spray a 9-inch square metal baking pan with cooking spray. Fold a 17-inch length of heavy-duty foil to 8 1/2 inches wide and fit in the pan bottom and up 2 sides, so you can use the foil overhang as a handle to pull the baked cake from the pan. Topping: Use hands to thoroughly mix ingredients in a medium bowl, pressing together to form large clumps; set aside. Cream cheese filling: Beat cream cheese and sugar with an electric mixer until thoroughly mixed. Beat in egg and vanilla until smooth; set aside. Cake: Mix flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl; set aside. Beat butter and sugar with an electric mixer set on medium-high until light and fluffy. Beat in egg until smooth. Beat in half the dry ingredients, then the remaining yogurt. Beat until ingredients are fully incorporated. Spread batter evenly over prepared pan. Spread cream cheese filling over batter. Dollop fruit filling (or sprinkle chocolate chips) over cream cheese filling. Finally, sprinkle evenly with crumble topping, pressing on it lightly to adhere. Bake until batter is fully set and topping is golden brown, about 45 minutes. Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes. Run a thin-bladed knife around the sides, then use foil handles to pull cake from pan onto the wire rack. Cool to room temperature and serve. Can be covered with foil and stored at room temperature for one day. If you understand how to vary the recipe, you only need one basic coffeecake in your repertoire. My all-purpose version consists of four components: batter, cream cheese filling, fruit preserves and crumb topping. The last three can be changed (or in some cases, omitted) to create a custom cake.
Cut lemons into slices about 1/4 inch thick and remove the fruit pulp. Cut the rings in half so the peels are in long strips. Bring water and lemon peel to a boil in a small pan. Drain water, and repeat with fresh cold water. Repeat the boiling step three times (see Editor's Note). Drain and set peels aside. Combine 2 cups fresh water with 2 cups sugar. Bring to a boil, stirring to dissolve the sugar. Reduce heat to low and stir in citrus peels; simmer until the white pith is translucent. Store peels in syrup, refrigerated, to keep them soft, or allow them to dry. Toss dry candied peels in additional sugar and store airtight at room temperature. This is a good way to use up lemon rind and it goes good with coffee or on cake. It really does taste like candy, and you can do this to ANY citrus fruit. If you use oranges you can add brandy, cloves or other spices the mixture. Chop it up and put it in cookies, or just eat it by itself.
Toss beef cubes with 2 tablespoons vegetable oil in a bowl. Whisk flour, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper in a separate bowl. Dredge beef cubes through flour mixture until evenly coated. Heat 1/4 cup vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir coated beef cubes, working in batches, until beef is browned on all sides, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer browned beef to a Dutch oven or heavy-bottomed pot. Cook and stir onions and garlic in the same skillet used for browning beef until lightly browned, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir tomato paste with enough water to partially dilute; pour into onion mixture. Stir to blend. Reduce heat to medium, cover Dutch oven, and simmer for 5 minutes. Pour half the Irish stout into the onion mixture, and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Transfer entire mixture to the browned beef. Pour remaining half of Irish stout into beef mixture; add thyme. Cover Dutch oven, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 2 hours. Add potatoes and carrots and simmer, stirring every 20 minutes, until potatoes are soft, about 1 hour. Adjust salt as needed; garnish with parsley. With this wonderful cool weather arriving this recipe is a perfect hearty Irish comfort food. After cooking and enjoying the great flavors, it reminded me and brought back warm thoughts of the mutton stew I had in Dublin, Ireland last year! Irish stew, is traditionally made of lamb or mutton, potatoes, onions, and parsley. But I am using beef. Original Irish stew was a thick and hearty meal, meant to keep a body warm and on your feet for many hours of hard work.
Soak beans in a large pot of water overnight. Drain beans, and refill the pot with chicken stock and enough water to cover the beans with 2 inches of liquid. Season with salt and pepper. Cover, and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and cook for 1 1/2 hours. Stir the beans occasionally through out the entire cooking process to make sure they do not burn or stick to the bottom of the pot. Stir beer, tomatoes, onion, jalapeno peppers, garlic, bay leaves, oregano, and cilantro into the beans. Continue to cook uncovered for 1 hour, or until beans are tender. With a potato masher, crush the beans slightly to thicken the bean liquid. Adjust the seasonings with salt and pepper to taste. Growing up, my Mexican grandmother always had a pot of beans cooking on the stove.  I often cook these beans (a 'drunken' version) for my family, and the aroma keeps her close to my soul, even years after she has past. I hope your family enjoys them as much as mine.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Once the water is boiling, stir in the lasagna noodles, about 3 or 4 at a time, and return to a boil. Cook the noodles uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through but is still firm to the bite, about 10 minutes per batch. Drain well in a colander set in the sink, and lay the cooked noodles flat on waxed paper or aluminum foil while you finish cooking the rest of the noodles. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x11-inch baking dish. Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for a minute or two. Using a potato masher, mash the potatoes with the milk and butter until smooth. Stir in 1 teaspoon of onion salt, and season with salt and pepper. Set the mashed potatoes aside to cool. When cooled, mix with shredded Cheddar cheese. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned and almost crisp, about 10 minutes. Place the onion into the hot bacon fat, and cook and stir until the onion is translucent, about 8 minutes. Break the bacon into pieces with a spoon or spatula, and set the bacon and onion aside. Mix the cottage cheese, egg, and 1 teaspoon of onion salt in a bowl. To make the casserole, place 3 lasagna noodles into the prepared baking dish, and spread with the cottage cheese mixture in an even layer. Top the cottage cheese with 3 more lasagna noodles, then spread potato-cheese mixture in a layer. Top the mashed potato layer with 3 more noodles, then spread the bacon and onion into an even layer on top of the casserole. Cover the casserole with aluminum foil, and bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the casserole is hot, about 30 minutes. Allow to set for about 10 minutes before serving. The deliciousness of perogies, all done up in a 9x11-inch pan...mmmmm!
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Butter a baking sheet. In a medium bowl, beat the eggs and sugar until thick and smooth. Fold in flour and hazelnuts. Use two spoons to form the dough into balls, and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 6 to 7 minutes in the preheated oven, or until toasted. A fast and easy recipe, for good cookies! Walnuts or almonds can be used instead of hazelnuts.
In a large bowl or crock pot, dissolve yeast and 1 cup flour in water. Cover with plastic wrap or a pot lid and let stand for 2 hours. Coarsely grind the soybeans in a food processor or blender. Stir soy beans and 1 cup flour into the yeast mixture. Let stand for 2 hours. Stir in the salt and remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out of the slow cooker and knead 1 1/2 tablespoons quinoa into the dough. Form into a loaf and place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Sprinkle the remaining quinoa on top of the loaf. Brush or drizzle on the olive oil. Cover and let rise until loaf is just above the top of the loaf pan. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 45 minutes, or until loaf sounds hollow when tapped on the bottom. Let cool before slicing. I use an old large slow cooker for my mixing bowl, this way I don't need to dirty up a bunch of different bowls or counters. The soybeans and quinoa give this bread great texture. I use an electric coffee grinder to grind up the soybeans.
In a medium bowl, combine the fish sauce, rice vinegar, water, sugar, garlic powder and chile pepper. Stir until sugar is dissolved. Taste to make sure the sweet, sour, salty and spicy flavors are balanced and adjust if necessary. Pour into bottles and seal with lids. A dipping sauce for rice rolls and for barbecued chicken, beef, pork or fish. Perfect for salads as is, or mix with a little vegetable oil. Make smaller quantities with lime or lemon juice but refrigerate as this will not last as the rice vinegar version does.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Add eggplant; cook, stirring constantly, until eggplant is softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomatoes and juice; cook until sauce is slightly reduced, about 20 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook rigatoni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, about 13 minutes. Drain and transfer to a serving bowl. Pour sauce over pasta. Easy and quick pasta dish!
In a medium bowl, stir together yogurt, salt, pepper, cloves, and ginger. Mix in garlic, paprika, cumin, cinnamon, and coriander. Set aside. Rinse chicken under cold water, and pat dry with paper towels. Place chicken in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour yogurt mixture over chicken, press air out of bag, and seal. Turn the bag over several times to distribute marinade. Place bag in a bowl, and refrigerate 8 hours, or overnight, turning bag occasionally. Preheat an outdoor grill for direct medium heat. Remove chicken from bag, and discard marinade. With paper towels, wipe off excess marinade. Spray chicken pieces with olive oil spray. Place chicken on the grill, and cook about 2 minutes. Turn, and cook 2 minutes more. Then arrange the chicken to receive indirect heat, and cook approximately 35 to 40 minutes, to an internal temperature of 180 degrees F. Moist, luscious, and delicious. Just the right blend of spices make this chicken dish one of my most-requested. Great hot or cold. If using thighs with skin, you can put over direct medium heat for the last few minutes to crisp skin.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 x 13 inch cake pan. Whip the sugar, eggs, baking powder, and the vanilla sugar. (To make Vanilla Sugar:   Place one clean vanilla bean in a pint jar with 1 - 1 1/2 cups white sugar.  Shake occasionally.  After a few days, use the sugar and replenish as necessary.)  Add the shortening and mix well. Stir in the flour, the cocoa powder, and the orange juice and mix until homogeneous. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake cake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for about 40 minutes. Remove cake from oven and immediately spread coffee glaze over top. To Make Glaze: Five minutes before cake is done, mix together confectioners' sugar, Nescafe powder, and milk.  Use immediately to spread over hot cake. This recipe makes an orange-accented chocolate cake with a coffee-flavored glaze
Lay bread on a work surface and spread butter on one side of each slice. Layer bacon, 1 slice of cheese, onion rings, avocado slices, and another slice of cheese on top of the unbuttered-side of the bread; top with second slice of bread, buttered-side facing up. Cook sandwiches in a skillet over medium heat, flipping once, until both sides are golden brown and cheese has melted, about 3 to 5 minutes per side. Not your typical grilled cheese. These flavors go great together. It's great without bacon for my vegetarian friends.
Whisk together the soy sauce, sugar, 2 teaspoons potato starch, sesame oil, and black pepper in a large bowl.  Mix the pork into the marinade and turn until all the pork is covered. Allow to rest for 15 minutes. To make the sauce, whisk together the water, vinegar, ketchup, 1/4 cup sugar, salt, 2 teaspoons potato starch, and red food coloring in a separate bowl. Set aside. Dip the pork pieces in the beaten egg, then dredge in the 1 cup potato starch.  Use your hand to press the starch onto the pork, assuring a consistent coating. Heat the peanut oil in a wok over medium-high heat to a temperature of 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the pork pieces in the hot oil until crisp and light brown, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove the pork from the oil and drain, keeping the oil hot.  Return the drained pork pieces to the hot oil for 30 seconds more.  Remove and drain again. Pour off all but 1 tablespoon of oil from the wok. Heat 1 tablespoon of reserved oil in the wok over medium heat. Cook the green bell pepper, cayenne pepper, pineapple, garlic, and green onion in the heated oil for about 5 minutes.  Add the sauce and stir until it thickens.  Stir in the pork and toss until the pork is coated with sauce.  Remove from heat and serve. This recipe requires three quick frying steps to seal in the crispy texture of the pork. Serve with rice or noodles for a filling meal.
Melt the butter and heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic, and cook until tender. Mix in the tomatoes, clam juice, and wine. Season with oregano, salt, and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer 10 minutes. Transfer soup in batches to a blender, and puree until smooth. Return to the pot, and stir in feta cheese. Continue cooking 10 minutes. Stir the shrimp into the soup, and continue cooking 3 minutes, or until shrimp are opaque. Mix in parsley just before serving. A wonderful shrimp soup flavored with feta cheese, clam juice, white wine & tomatoes. Even the pickiest eaters in my family love it! Pinot Grigio is suggested for the wine.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a casserole dish. In a bowl, stir together the cream of celery soup, sour cream, Cheddar cheese, onion, and salt until well combined. Mix the green beans and corn together in the prepared dish, and spread the soup mixture over the vegetables. Place the crushed crackers in a bowl and stir in the butter. Spread the crumbs over the casserole. Bake in the preheated oven until the casserole is bubbling and the crumb topping is golden brown, about 45 minutes. This is my mom's personal twist to the original green bean casserole. She has made this every Thanksgiving because our family demands it!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x5 inch loaf pan. In a large bowl, combine melted butter and honey. Whisk in yogurt, egg and lemon juice.

So, after experimenting a bit, this is what I came up with. I think it is even better than those buttery, fatty versions. This recipe also yields lots of yummy gravy, so it's great with mashed potatoes.

Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork slices in oil until no longer pink in the center, about 2 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). I made this up one night with garlic mashed potatoes and my husband made me swear to include it in the rotation. It originated from a marinade my mother had for moose meat, but the lime and chili garlic sauce adds a fresh twist. Warning: I didn't measure; it's all approximations to your taste!

Cover, and refrigerate until serving. This is a great cold salad dish with little preparation time. It has a Greek flair to it and is delicious. I always come home with an empty dish. The key to it is using fresh tomatoes if you have them. Hope you enjoy it as much as we have.

Puree half of the soup in small batches, filling the blender no more than halfway full each time. Return soup puree to pot. Cook on low 10 to 15 minutes. Season with thyme and salt and pepper before serving. If you are a fan of fresh (or even dried) morel mushrooms, this is the soup for you. Everyone who eats morels knows that they go best sauteed with onions, garlic and butter. This incorporates all of those ingredients to create a magnificently creamy soup, strong with morel flavor, but not too overpowering. This isn't healthy eating, and I don't recommend trying to make it that way. Just eat less of it! Serve with crusty bread or garlic croutons.

Brush hens with remaining olive oil and season with salt and black pepper. Bake hens in the preheated oven until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Remove hens to a platter, tent loosely with aluminum foil, and let rest for 10 minutes. Place roasting pan over medium-high heat. Stir chicken broth, fresh cranberries, and maple syrup into the pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Cook and stir until sauce reduces and thickens, 1 to 3 minutes. Spoon sauce over stuffed hens. If you've never worked with game hens before, they're very user-friendly. Even stuffed to excess, they only roast for about an hour in a hot oven, and as long as you don't overcook them (use a thermometer!), you'll be enjoying the kind of juicy, flavorful meat that people cooking turkey only dream of.
Fill a pot with water and bring to a boil. Cook the chicken breasts in the boiling water until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 10 minutes.

Flip the sandwiches, and bake an additional 6 to 8 minutes, or until golden brown. My husband and I were sick of frying grilled cheeses on the stove because you have so many pieces of bread to use, and you have to stand there for a long time if you feed up to six people like we do. So we came up with this idea.

If dough is too sticky, add more masa harina; if it begins to dry out, sprinkle with water. Cover dough tightly with plastic wrap and allow to stand for 30 minutes. Preheat a cast iron skillet or griddle to medium-high. Divide dough into 15 equal-size balls. Using a tortilla press, a rolling pin, or your hands, press each ball of dough flat between two sheets of plastic wrap. Immediately place tortilla in preheated pan and allow to cook for approximately 30 seconds, or until browned and slightly puffy. Turn tortilla over to brown on second side for approximately 30 seconds more, then transfer to a plate. Repeat process with each ball of dough. Keep tortillas covered with a towel to stay warm and moist until ready to serve. This is the real thing!  A simple mixture of masa harina and water results in the most wonderful corn tortillas you ever tasted. The secret is to use a cast iron pan! You can buy masa harina at Mexican grocery stores or in the ethnic food aisle of large supermarkets.
Combine the milk, 1 tablespoon sugar, and the yeast in a large bowl; stir the egg yolks and whipping cream into the milk mixture. Allow to rest for 10 minutes. Whisk together the flour, 1/4 cup of sugar, and salt in a mixing bowl. Cut in the cold butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. (This can also be done in a food processor: pulse the cold butter or shortening until it's the size of small peas. Turn mixture into a bowl and proceed.) Stir in yeast mixture until combined. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for 4 hours. Turn dough onto a lightly floured board. Divide the dough into three portions and shape them into balls. Toss blackberries with sugar. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Roll each ball out to a 9x12-inch rectangle. Spoon blackberries evenly onto the center third of each rectangle, width-wise. Using a knife, cut about 9 slanting lines along each side approximately 1 inch apart. Create a braid by folding alternating strips from each side, overlapping the berries. Place the pastry braid onto the prepared baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining two portions. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Sprinkle with confectioners' sugar before serving. This is a wonderful sweet bread that wraps up sweetened blackberries. I have made this recipe for my family for over 15 years. Sprinkle with powdered sugar.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add potatoes and cook until tender but still firm, about 15 minutes. Drain, toss with butter, and season with salt and pepper. Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Remove the bacon and drain on paper towels. Set aside the pan with the bacon grease. In a large bowl gently toss together the dandelion greens and onion. In a small bowl, whisk together the egg, vinegar, and sugar. Season with salt and pepper. Stir the egg mixture into the skillet with the warm bacon grease. Mix in the diced bacon and flour, and whisk for about 1 minute, until thickened to the consistency of salad dressing. Pour at once over the dandelions and toss to coat. Serve the greens over the potatoes. Dandelions are a healthy, wonderful way to ring in the spring. You can find dandelion greens in the store but fresh picked are the best. Make sure to get them early in the spring for the most tender greens! Yes, the little flower buds are edible.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. Whisk together the rice flour, sugar and baking powder; set aside.

Allow to cool completely. Turn the pan of mochi out onto a clean surface that has been dusted with potato starch. Cut into bite size pieces using a plastic knife. The mochi does not stick as much to plastic knives. Soft and chewy Japanese dessert.  A tradition of boy's or girl's day.  Great for a snack for picnics or parties. This recipe is easy to make, but do not try cheating and double it.  The directions should be followed exactly.
Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the peanut butter, shortening, white sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Stir in the water and baking mix. Mix in the chocolate chips. Roll into walnut sized balls and place 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheet. Flatten slightly with the tines of a fork. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Easy, delicious recipe for peanut butter chocolate chip cookies.  No one will ever know they took so little work.  I like them a little underbaked.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Wrap beets in foil. Bake the beets until tender, about 1 hour; allow to cool, then peel the beets. Cut them into bite-size chunks. Heat the olive oil in a soup pot over medium heat, and cook the red onion, leek, and garlic until the onion is translucent, about 5 minutes. Pour in the vegetable broth, and mix in the beets, bay leaves, cinnamon, salt, black pepper, oregano, basil, cinnamon, cumin, and tarragon. Bring the soup to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, and cook until the flavors of the bay leaves and spices are blended, 20 to 25 minutes. Pick out bay leaves. Ladle about 1/4 of the beets into a blender, and add soup liquid as needed to fill the blender about 1/4 full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the beets and broth moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree the beets until smooth, and pour back into the soup. This is a rich, flavorful, vegetarian soup that hits the spot!  Sweet and spicy undertones complement the beets.  Great as a meal or as an appetizer.
Grease a 9 inch square pan and set aside. Combine the sugar, butter, eggnog, nutmeg, and cinnamon in a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, stirring occasionally to melt the butter. Once the mixture reaches a rolling boil, stop stirring, and clip a candy thermometer onto the pan. Heat mixture to 235 degrees F (113 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the white chocolate pieces, marshmallow cream, vanilla, and walnuts. Beat the mixture with a wooden spoon until fluffy and it starts to lose its gloss. Spoon into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Cool completely, then cut into small squares for serving. This eggnog-flavored fudge is made with white chocolate, eggnog, some nutmeg, and cinnamon. It's a very rich fudge worth every nibble!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. Drain. Stir together macaroni, shredded Cheddar cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream, Parmesan cheese, and salt and pepper in a 9x13-inch baking dish. Mix together bread crumbs and melted butter in a small bowl; sprinkle topping over macaroni mixture. Bake until top is golden in the preheated oven, 30 to 35 minutes. We kept the cottage cheese and sour cream that make this macaroni and cheese recipe unique, but used lower-fat versions of each. The healthier version also uses whole grain macaroni and whole wheat breadcrumbs.
Rinse the beef and pat dry. Crush the garlic cloves into a paste and combine it with the crushed ginger. Add the vinegar, salt, pepper, roasted curry powder, and cayenne. Mix in the beef cubes and toss to coat. Set aside for 30 minutes. Heat the oil in a Dutch oven over medium heat. Add the curry leaves and pandan strips. Stir in the onions. Cook, stirring frequently, until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Mix in the beef cubes and cook until browned on all sides, about 10 minutes. Stir in the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, and cloves. Add the tomato paste and water and mix well. Simmer, covered, on low heat for 1 1/2 hours or until the meat is tender. Check the curry every half hour; you may need to add more water (up to 1 cup) if the curry is too dry and is sticking to the pan. Add the coconut milk and heat through. Taste and adjust the seasonings before serving. This beef curry uses roasted curry powder.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9x13 baking pan. In large bowl, combine the sugar, flour, salt, baking soda and cinnamon. Make a well in the center and stir in the oil, eggs and pie filling. Stir until just combined. Spoon batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 45 to 50 minutes or until cake tests done. A moist and fruity cake that 's' a snap to make! Serve it warm from the oven with a scoop of ice cream of a dollop of whipped cream.

Reduce heat to low, and cook at least 1 hour, until vegetables are tender and rice is cooked. Even kids who don't care for vegetable soup may enjoy this one. Very good flavor. Sometimes I use crushed tomatoes with garlic, onion, or basil now that they're available. Turkey smoked sausage is great in this recipe!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour an 8 inch pan. In a medium bowl, beat together the eggs and 1 cup of sugar. Combine the flour, baking powder and salt, stir into the egg mixture. Then, stir in the dates, walnuts and vanilla. Pour into the prepared pan. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Cool on the pan on a wire rack. When the cake is cooled, break into bite sized pieces. Stir the cake pieces together with the oranges, bananas and remaining sugar. Press into a medium sized bowl and chill for several hours. Invert cake onto a serving plate. Whip the heavy cream with the confectioners' sugar and vanilla until stiff. Spread over the entire cake. Fruit-filled cake topped with whipped cream. It's really delicious. My Mom, Corina Compagner, has been making this recipe for Christmas for over 30 years.
Put sugar and water into a cocktail shaker and stir to dissolve. Add orange slices to the shaker and pour in sherry. Fill with ice, shake well, and strain into a tall glass full of crushed ice. Garnish with seasonal berries and a fresh slice of orange. Probably invented in the 1830s when the 'frozen water trade' was just hitting its stride. A very refreshing summer drink when the berries are in season.
In a large soup pot, cook chicken in water until the meat begins to fall off the bone. Skim fat off stock.  Remove the chicken from pot, and set aside to cool.  Add pasta to stock, and cook for about 10 minutes.  Shut off heat. In a medium bowl, beat 2 eggs with the juice of 2 lemons until foamy.  Whisk 1 cup stock slowly into the egg/lemon mixture.  Repeat with another cup of stock, and pour mixture into soup. Bone chicken, and add meat to soup.  Stir well.  Add salt and pepper to taste. Slightly tangy and quite filling! For added flavor use fat free chicken stock in place of water.
Cover chanterelle mushrooms with hot water, cover, and set aside to soften for 30 minutes. Once soft, remove the mushrooms from the water and chop; discard water. Melt butter along with truffle oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add the onion, shallot, and garlic; cook and stir two minutes until the onion begins to soften. Add the fresh mushrooms, and continue cooking until the mushroom softens and begins to release its liquid. Stir in the chopped chanterelle mushrooms, and cook 3 minutes more. Add Arborio rice; cook and stir for a few minutes until the rice is well coated with the onion mixture and looks glossy. Stir in the white wine, and cook until nearly evaporated. Reduce heat to medium, and add 1/3 of the hot chicken stock. Cook and stir until the chicken stock has been mostly absorbed, about 5 minutes. The risotto should be simmering gently while you stir in the chicken stock. Add half of the remaining stock, and stir for 5 minutes more. Finally add the remaining stock, and continue cooking until the risotto is creamy and the rice is tender, about 5 minutes more. The rice should not be completely soft, but still have a little firmness when you bite into it. You can add a little water if needed to cook the rice to this state. Remove the risotto from the heat, and stir in the heavy cream and Gorgonzola cheese. Season to taste with salt and pepper, and serve. This savory, well balanced risotto with dried chanterelles and Gorgonzola cheese works well as a main course.
Without separating the dough, roll out both packs of crescent rolls onto a baking sheet, forming them into a single, flat surface. Bake according to the directions on the package. Allow the finished rolls to cool. In a bowl, Mix together the cream cheese, mayonnaise, basil and garlic powder. Spread the mixture evenly over the surface of the rolls. Spread the broccoli, cauliflower and carrots on top of the cream cheese mixture. Sprinkle the salad seasoning mix over all. Cut into squares and serve. This is a delicious and super easy appetizer to make.  Served cold it is also sometimes called 'veggie pizza.'
Melt butter in a heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Cook andouille sausage in the melted butter until completely browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon to a plate lined with paper towel. Cook and stir onion, celery, and green bell pepper in the butter remaining in the pot until the onion becomes translucent, 5 to 10 minutes. Stir garlic into the onion mixture; cook and stir together for 1 minute. Stir tomato paste through the vegetable mixture; cook and stir another 3 to 5 minutes. Return andouille sausage to the pot along with diced tomatoes, Worcestershire sauce, Cajun seasoning, and black pepper; stir to combine. Pour chicken broth over the sausage mixture; bring to a boil. Stir rice into the mixture, place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook undisturbed until the rice is tender, 25 to 30 minutes. Add shrimp and cod to the rice mixture. Increase heat to medium-high and cook until the mixture comes to a boil; reduce heat again to medium-low and cook uncovered another 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Season with salt and fold parsley into the jambalaya to serve. Did a lot of research on jambalaya and reviewed a number of recipes and came up with the following. I like white fish and, while not traditional, added chunks of cod fillet to this dish. You want to add the shrimp and fish to the dish with about 10 minutes to go so it does not overcook. Cook uncovered if it is soupy and covered if it is not during these last 10 minutes. Finally, try to find andouille sausage if possible. It makes all the difference.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the cola and ketchup in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Add the chicken pieces, turning to coat well. Bake skin side down for 30 minutes.

Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Put shrimp in a bowl. Drizzle olive oil and sprinkle paprika and salt over the shrimp, stir to coat shrimp completely. Cook the shrimp on the preheated grill until they are bright pink on the outside and the meat is no longer transparent in the center, about 2 minutes per side. Transfer shrimp to a plate and serve with lemon aioli. You'll notice a glaring lack of ingredients in this recipe. Thanks to the intensely flavored cured lemons, the aioli sauce needs little more than some fresh tarragon to reach its full potential. Having said that, you are well within your rights to toss in some garlic or hot pepper if you're in the mood.
Toss the shrimp, white wine vinegar, seafood seasoning, and cumin together in a bowl. Heat the oil in a pot over medium heat; cook the onions in the oil until they begin to brown, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in the celery, carrot, red bell pepper, and scotch bonnet pepper; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Add the garlic and cook another 3 minutes. Whisk the curry powder into 1/2 cup of water in a small bowl; pour into the pot while also adding the potatoes; mix to coat and allow to cook 2 to 3 minutes more. Pour in 2 cups hot water and bring mixture to a boil. Gently lie the green beans into the pot. Allow the mixture to simmer until the potatoes are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Add the shrimp and cook another 5 minutes. Sprinkle the cilantro leaves over the mixture and season with salt and pepper just before serving. This is my version of curried potatoes, green beans, and shrimp. It's yummy! This recipe is versatile in that if you want to make it vegetarian just leave out the shrimp! Use a Trinidadian brand of curry powder if available. Serve this over steamed basmati rice or with naan.

Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the onion, zucchini, mushrooms, red and yellow pepper for about 5 minutes, until the vegetables have softened. While the vegetables are cooking, stir together honey, 1 tablespoon of oil, lemon juice, ginger, and black pepper in a bowl. Stir honey mixture, cooked vegetables, and pineapple into the cooked rice, bring the mixture back to a boil, and serve hot. A quick and easy way to cook the most flavorsome yellow rice and the best-ever vegetables.

Refrigerate for 1 to 2 days before using so that the flavors will blend. Shake occasionally, and store for up to 2 months in the refrigerator. I have tried a lot of recipes of Eastern North Carolina BBQ Sauce. This is the closest to what you will find in any of the BBQ Restaurants here in North Carolina. It is on the hot side, so you may wish to adjust the cayenne pepper and Tabasco™ sauce for milder flavor.
Whisk flour, baking powder, salt, and brown sugar in bowl. Beat egg and milk together and stir in peanut butter until smooth in a second bowl. Whisk the milk mixture into the dry ingredients just until moistened, then whisk in melted butter and vanilla extract. Gently fold chocolate chips and diced banana into the batter. Place a large nonstick skillet over medium heat and pour 1/4 cup of batter per pancake into the middle of the skillet.

Place cabbage and onions into a large pot over medium-high heat. Add roasted bell peppers. Stir in sugar, apple cider vinegar, turmeric, mustard seed, and celery seed. Bring to a low boil, stirring constantly to prevent onions from sticking to the bottom. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer for 45 minutes, stirring often. To prepare jars you first need to wash jars then place them into the canning pot with rack and boil them in water to sterilize them. Fill a small pot half way with water and bring to simmer; place the lids into water. Taking one jar out of the water at a time put on canning funnel and fill with hot relish about 1/2 inch from the top. Then take a kitchen knife a stick down to the bottom of jar and work the knife around to remove all air bubbles. Wipe off top of jar very well and clean then place a hot lid on jar the screw ring on top. Repeat until all relish is gone. Jars and relish must stay hot throughout this canning process. Place in a bath of simmering water, covering the jars by one inch. Process for 10 minutes, or according to your local extension's guidelines. When jars start to seal and vacuum, the lids will make a pop sound and your canning was a success. Once jars have been opened, store in the refrigerator and use within two weeks. A sweet and tangy onion relish that can be used as you would most any relish. Great on subs and cooked into cornbread.

Place 1 tablespoon of butter into the potatoes, and allow to melt, then mix in the flour until thoroughly combined. Mix in egg and salt. Turn the mixture out onto a generously floured work surface, and knead until the dough is soft and no longer sticky, about 10 minutes. Divide the dough into quarters, and subdivide each quarter into fourths to make 16 portions. Roll each portion into a ball, and roll the ball out on a floured work surface until it forms a circle about 3 1/2 inches in diameter. Place a pitted plum into the center of the dough circle, and spoon a teaspoon of sugar into the plum. Roll and pinch the dough around the plum to seal. Repeat with the remaining dough to make 16 dumplings. Bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil over medium heat, and drop the dumplings into the boiling water. Stir gently to loosen any dumplings that stick to the bottom. Allow the dumplings to rise to the top, then boil for 5 more minutes.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place pretzels and Parmesan cheese into a food processor; pulse until the pretzels are finely crushed and combined with cheese. Mix in parsley and garlic powder by pulsing once or twice. Transfer the mixture to a shallow dish. Remove chicken from the marinade, and shake off excess. Discard the remaining marinade. Press chicken into pretzel mixture, coating both sides. Arrange coated chicken in a baking dish. Sprinkle about 1 tablespoon additional pretzel mixture on top. Bake chicken breasts in the preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Cover chicken with a foil tent and allow to rest for 10 to 15 minutes before slicing and serving. This recipe was inspired by a wedding reception that I attended. The original was stuffed with a creamy white cheese (possibly Gouda).  I omitted the cheese on the inside, and instead opted to add Parmesan to the outside. This is delicious! Crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. The measurements for the marinade are an estimate.

When all of the sugar has been absorbed, pickles will be dark green and crispy. Transfer pickles to smaller sterile jars, and divide syrup between jars. Seal with lids and rings. Store in the refrigerator, and consume within one month. These spicy/sweet pickles are a Texas tradition.  My mother and I have made these delectable pickles for Christmas every year since I was young.  We separate each batch into smaller jars and give them as gifts to friends and family.

Baste the chicken with juices in the roasting pan. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and roast until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Baste occasionally during roasting. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (80 degrees C). Remove the chicken from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area for 10 minutes before slicing. A weekend favorite, we call this 'sticky' chicken at our house, since the roasted spices and honey form a sticky, sweet and spicy coating during roasting. Wonderful when paired with a fresh green salad!

Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Make three slashes across each side of the fish using a sharp knife. This will keep the fish from curling as it cooks. Place the fish in a shallow baking dish or roasting pan. Cover each side with fresh ginger, then green onions and tomatoes. Season with sea salt. Slice half of the lime and place the slices on top of the fish. Drizzle with the soy sauce, and squeeze the other half of the lime over the fish. Cut the lemon in half and set in the pan. Cover the whole dish with aluminum foil. Bake the fish until the flesh is opaque and can be flaked with a fork, about 20 minutes. Squeeze the baked lemon halves over the fish before serving. Serve the fillet on the top side first, then gently lift out the backbone, while helping the flesh off the bones with your knife. It's much easier than trying to turn the fish over. This is such an easy dish to cook and healthy way to eat fish. It is so versatile you can eat it during the week in front of the TV or for a dinner party!

Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. While the pasta and cabbage are cooking, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute onions until tender. Combine cabbage, pasta, onions, salt, pepper and soy sauce; mix well and transfer to a 9x13 inch casserole dish. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes. This is a quick and simple side or main dish of noodles, cabbage and onions. I had this at a potluck supper and it disappeared in no time.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Mix the onions and celery together in the bottom of a large roasting pan. In a large bowl, thoroughly mix together the veal and pork with your hands; lightly mix in cream of mushroom soup, cracker crumbs, bread crumbs, evaporated milk, eggs, salt, marjoram, onion flakes, and pepper until well combined.

Bake in the preheated oven for 1 hour and remove foil. Carefully separate the meat balls where they have stuck together and return the pan to the oven until the meat balls are browned, turning every 15 minutes, 30 to 45 additional minutes. This recipe is my grandfather George Franek's.  He passed away recently, but this is one dish from his legacy.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). In a small bowl, dissolve instant coffee crystals into the coffee liqueur; set aside. In a large bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and white sugar. Gradually add eggs and coffee mixture while mixing. Sift together the flour, cocoa, baking soda, and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop dough by rounded tablespoonfuls onto a cookie sheet.

Pierce the cotechino with a fork in several places. In a large pot place the cotechino, chopped onion, 1 bay leaf, peppercorns and thyme. Cover with water and bring all to a boil. Reduce heat to low and let simmer for 45 to 50 minutes, if using fresh cotechino (for precooked cotechino, simmer for 20 minutes). In a large pot combine the lentils, quartered onion, garlic, bay leaf, carrot and salt and pepper to taste. Cover with the 4 cups of water. Bring all to a boil; cover, reduce heat to low and let simmer for 40 to 45 minutes or until lentils are soft. Add additional water if necessary. Remove the onion, garlic, bay leaf and carrot; discard. Spoon the lentils into a serving dish, drizzle with olive oil and slice rounds of the cotechino over the top. Sprinkle with fresh chopped parsley and serve. This hearty and satisfying dish is traditionally eaten on New Year's to bring abundance and fortune. Cotechino is an Italian fresh pork sausage. It is creamy and delicate in flavor. It is sometimes sold precooked or boiled but the best ones are fresh. If you can't find cotechino a high quality fresh pork sausage flavored with nutmeg, cloves and pepper will suffice.
Stir the beer, brown sugar, kosher salt, paprika, black pepper, cayenne pepper, and teriyaki marinade together in a bowl. Rub the chicken legs thoroughly with the vegetable oil. Poke several holes in the flesh of the chicken legs with a fork; arrange in a single layer in a glass dish. Pour the marinade over the chicken legs; marinate in refrigerator for 1 hour. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat, and lightly oil the grate. Remove the chicken from the marinade and shake off any excess liquid. Discard remaining marinade. Grill the chicken legs on the preheated grill until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, turning one-quarter turn every 5 minutes, 20 to 25 minutes total. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the leg, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Yummy and delish!!!!
Blend the watermelon, honeydew, and about half the blueberries in a blender until smooth. Add the ginger and nutmeg; blend again until incorporated.

Heat the oil in a large skillet or wok over medium heat, and cook the garlic in the hot oil until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes. Mix in the bok choy, and cook and stir until the green parts of the leaves turn bright green and the stalks become slightly translucent, 5 to 8 minutes. Sprinkle with salt to serve. There's no better way to enjoy the crisp delicate taste of bok choy. This basic stir-fry can be served as is, or you can add meat or tofu to make it more substantial. Quick and easy, this is one of my favorite ways to load up on leafy greens. Serve with fluffy white rice, or over noodles in soup. The bok choy cooks down quite a bit, so the raw amount may look like it will be too much before cooking. You can use regular bok choy instead of baby bok choy if you like, although I prefer the sweeter and more delicate flavor of baby bok choy. If you want a more robust flavor, feel free to add some soy sauce or oyster sauce to the finished product, but personally I like to let the simple but delicious taste of the bok choy shine through.
Beat the eggs in a mixing bowl until light and frothy. Mix in the sugar, cinnamon, and cloves until the sugar dissolves.  Beat in the vanilla ice cream, lemon juice, and orange juice on low speed. Cover and refrigerate at least 2 hours. Just before serving, stir in the ginger ale. This punch is a Christmas tradition at our home, and a wonderful alternative to traditional eggnog. It is not too heavy and the addition of ginger ale gives it a kick! You can make it several days in advance and wait until the last minute to add ginger ale. I also freeze a ginger ale ice ring and add it to the punch bowl to help keep the punch cold. Add cinnamon swizzle sticks to your glasses for pretty presentation.

Place half of the potatoes, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper and onion in the roasting pan and cover with the remaining butter, garlic, lemon pepper, and seasoning blend. Mix in the remaining potatoes, green bell pepper, yellow bell pepper, orange bell pepper and onion. Pour in the beer until it reaches just below the top layer of vegetables. Cover pan with foil, place pan on the grill grate, and cook 1 1/2 hours, or until the potatoes are tender. Remove pan from the grill, cover with the shredded cheese, and let stand until the cheese has melted. These potatoes are total 'man-food' and I've never met a person that didn't like them. They must be cooked over a grill, oven roasting just doesn't turn out the same.
Combine honey, apple cider, water, lemon juice, and cinnamon stick in a saucepan; bring to a boil. Lower heat to medium and simmer, stirring frequently, until smooth, about 5 minutes. Add pears and cranberries and return to a boil; reduce heat to medium and simmer until sauce is thickened, 12 to 15 minutes. Refrigerate until chilled and flavors have blended, at least 2 hours. This spicy cranberry sauce uses honey and pears to sweeten it instead of sugar. I try to prepare this at least a few hours ahead of time to allow all the flavors to blend, but if you don't have time to wait, it's still delicious. A beautiful sweet/tart addition to any feast.
In a small bowl, stir together the ketchup, mustard powder, garlic powder, pepper, and Worcestershire sauce. Cover and refrigerate for at least 1 hour to blend the flavors before serving.

I've taken my old chocolate zucchini cake recipe, cut out almost all of the bad stuff and loaded it up with so many fruits and vegetables that it's more like a baked salad than a cake. The funny thing is that it turned out so moist and tasty that you'll find yourself fighting with the kids for the last piece. Try it once and you'll be a believer too!

Beat in the eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla and almond extracts. Combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the peanut butter mixture. Roll dough into 1 inch balls and place them 2 inches apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Use a wet fork dipped in sugar to make the crisscrosses on the top. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow cookies to cool on baking sheet for 5 minutes before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Grab a glass of milk and enjoy! My mother used to make these cookies when my brothers and I were growing up. They are easy and are very delicious. Hope someone out there likes them as well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place the potatoes into a saucepan and fill with enough water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook for 15 minutes, or until tender. Drain and mash with margarine and milk until fairly smooth. Meanwhile, crumble the ground beef into a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper. Cook and stir until beef is browned; drain excess fat. Place the beef and onion mixture into the bottom of the pie shell, pour the cream-style corn over it. Spread mashed potatoes to cover the top of the pie. Bake for 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the pie crust and potatoes are golden brown. This savory beef pie is so easy to make and is one of my husband's favorites. The leftovers are perfect for lunch the next day. For added flavor, you could top the potatoes with a cup of shredded Cheddar cheese, if desired.
Boil the lentils in broth in a covered pan until the lentils are soft and all the broth has been absorbed, about 30 minutes. Remove from heat, and let cool. Place lentils in a food processor. Pour in olive oil and truffle oil, and pulse until almost smooth. Season with salt and pepper to taste, and add additional truffle oil if desired. Pulse to preferred thickness and consistency. If too thick, pour in a few teaspoons of water or broth to thin. A 'pate' made out of lentils, flavored with truffle oil. Tastes just like real pate!
Rinse the outer rind of the watermelon thoroughly, and pat dry. Set the watermelon in a position so it will not roll over. Press the tip of a funnel through the rind of the melon. If using a plastic funnel, you may need to cut a hole. Situate the melon on a towel in the bottom of the refrigerator or on the counter. Pour rum into the funnel a little at a time, refilling as it seeps into the melon. I start the afternoon before, since we usually leave to go to events in the morning. Allow the melon to marinate at least a few hours, before removing the funnel. Slice just before serving. Adults only!  This is watermelon and liquor...perfect for BBQ's, picnics, camping and by the pool!  Use any liquor you like, even wine works!  I use seedless watermelon, but you don't have to.
Place broth and spinach in a pot over medium heat, and cook 5 minutes, or until spinach is thawed. Mix in dark and light kidney beans, black beans and liquid, great northern beans and liquid, pinto beans and liquid, and oil. Season with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook 30 minutes, stirring occasionally. This recipe is great for vegetarians or people who just like beans, and it freezes well.
In a large skillet over medium heat, cook onions in oil until translucent.  Stir in celery, carrot, rosemary, tarragon, thyme and parsley and cook, covered, until vegetables are soft, 5 to 10 minutes. Transfer vegetable mixture to a large pot and pour in chicken broth.  Simmer over low heat, covered, for 30 minutes. Stir in chicken breast pieces and egg noodles and simmer, covered, 30 minutes more.  Season with salt and pepper. Easily made, this is a wonderfully flavorful chicken noodle soup that will cure any common disease and make your guests happy.
Slice the tomato into wedges.  In a salad bowl, combine the cucumber, bell pepper, red onion and tomatoes. Whisk together the oil, vinegar, Dijon mustard, mustard seed, dry mustard and hot sauce. Pour the vinaigrette over salad and toss to coat. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Chill for several hours. This is a fresh vegetable salad with a trio of mustards.
Stir coconut milk, oats, chia seeds, lemon zest, and vanilla extract together in a bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate, 8 hours to overnight. Heat oats mixture in the microwave until warmed-through, about 1 minute. Top with blueberries. Easy, vegan, healthy. This is also great with orange zest and dried cranberries. Add walnuts or almonds for some crunch. You can substitute almond milk or soy milk for the coconut milk, if desired.
Blend almond milk, bananas, dates, almond butter, cinnamon, flax seeds, and nutmeg together in a blender until smooth. Fast, nutritious smoothie that is delightfully not too sweet but just right.
Cook pasta according to directions. Meanwhile process all the ingredients except basil and oil in a blender. Add oil; process for 30 seconds. Drain pasta; toss with pesto and basil. A mixed blend of nuts and cheese with orange zest and basil makes a fabulous pesto sauce to toss with Barilla Whole Grain Spaghetti.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a large pot, bring the squash to boil. Reduce to a simmer until squash is soft. In a large bowl, mash the softened squash. Mix in the mayonnaise, onion, egg, brown sugar, salt and pepper. Pour the mixture into a 2 quart baking dish. In a medium bowl, mix together crackers, Parmesan and butter. Sprinkle over the squash mixture. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven for 35 to 45 minutes, until the topping is lightly brown. I got this recipe from a relative years ago. Delicious, colorful squash is baked with a crunchy Parmesan cheese topping. It's excellent -- please try it!
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cut the shrimp along the back, nearly through to the front. Stuff each shrimp with a sliver of jalapeno, then wrap with half a slice of bacon. Secure with a toothpick. Repeat with the remaining ingredients. Cook the shrimp in batches in the hot oil until the bacon is crispy and golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving. My father and his Chinese 'brother's' recipe for the best deep fried shrimp, now famous in our town. If you have leftover bacon, don't worry; you can deep fry it and that's for you! For a sauce, ketchup and horseradish work great but these are great by them self!
Line a 9x9 inch baking dish with whole graham crackers without overlapping them. In a saucepan over medium heat, bring to a boil 1/2 cup butter, brown sugar, and egg. Stir in the graham cracker crumbs, coconut, and walnuts. Remove saucepan from heat. Carefully spread over whole graham crackers, covering entire surface of baking dish. Beat together 1/2 cup butter, evaporated milk, custard powder, powdered sugar, and vanilla. Spread icing evenly on top of crushed graham cracker filling. Cover, and refrigerate. My mum has been making these delicious, no-bake squares every holiday for years! They make a pretty addition to any holiday platter of cookies, bars, and squares, which makes them great for entertaining. They can also be made early and frozen. These are very sweet and rich, so cut them fairly small.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. Beat shortening with brown sugar, white sugar, and vanilla in a bowl until creamy. Add egg; beat until smooth. Add flour, baking soda, and salt; mix until incorporated. Fold in 1 cup peanut butter chips, toffee bits, and peanuts. Drop batter by the rounded tablespoonful about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake cookies in the preheated oven until deep golden brown and just set in the middle, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on sheet for 3 minutes before transferring to wire racks to cool completely. Heat remaining peanut butter chips in a microwave-safe bowl in the microwave until melted, about 45 seconds. Drizzle over cooled cookies. Great alternative to the holiday snack!
In a medium serving bowl, combine the grapes, walnuts, onion, green onion, radishes and raisins. Toss with balsamic vinaigrette dressing just before serving. Red grapes, walnuts, onions and more are mixed with balsamic vinaigrette for a fresh summer salad.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil.

Mix cream cheese with Parmesan, Cheddar, and feta cheeses, garlic, salt, black pepper, cayenne pepper, chili powder, and garlic powder in a bowl. Arrange jalapeno peppers on prepared baking sheet. Spoon cheese mixture into each pepper. Bake in the preheated oven until cheese is melted and bubbling, about 10 minutes. These are a great appetizer - jalapeno peppers stuffed with 4 kinds of cheese and spices, then baked.
Place the potatoes into a large pot and cover with lightly salted water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until just tender, about 15 minutes.

Remove lid, stir, and simmer for another hour with lid off. Serve hot. Just before eating, squeeze in fresh lime juice to taste and sprinkle with remaining cilantro.

A twist on the old standby! I like to use my homemade tomato sauce for this recipe, as well as using crushed croutons as the bread crumbs. A hint for shelling the eggplants - use a grapefruit spoon to start!
In a small bowl, combine celery salt, pepper, savory, cloves, cinnamon, thyme, sage and mustard powder. Mix well and store in a sealed jar. A blend of spices used in the traditional French-Canadian tourtiere (meat pie). I use beef, pork and veal, but this mix goes with any combination.

Depending on taste, some people like it served with a chopped boiled egg and a few squeezes of fresh lemon.
In a large cast iron skillet, heat shortening over medium-high heat. Add potatoes and cook, stirring occasionally, until potatoes are golden brown.

Remove chicken from skillet and keep warm. Pour white wine into the skillet and scrape pan to dissolve any browned bits of food on the bottom. Mix in lemon juice, reduce heat to low, and simmer until sauce is slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir often. Stir capers into sauce and place chicken back into skillet, turning to coat with sauce. To serve, transfer chicken to a serving platter, top with sauce, and garnish with lemon slices and fresh parsley. This is the most requested dish by my teens' friends! Great even as leftovers, if there ever are any! Best served with a risotto or fettucine alfredo with a side of broccoli. Not for the diet conscious!
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line cookie sheets with parchment paper. In a large bowl, cream together brown sugar and shortening until smooth. Mix in 1 egg, milk, and vanilla until smooth. Stir in the baking soda, cinnamon, and molasses. Mix in flour until the dough is stiff enough to roll out. Roll dough out on a lightly floured surface to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into cookies using a pig shaped cookie cutter. Place cookies 2 inches apart on the prepared baking sheets. Brush the remaining beaten egg over the tops of the cookies. Bake for 15 to 17 minutes in the preheated oven, or until the centers of the cookies appear dry and edges are lightly browned. Marranitos (or cochinos, or puerquitos, as are they are called in some Mexican-American communities) are often called 'Gingerbread Pigs,' although they don't actually have ginger in them - and no cinnamon either. In fact, traditional marranitos get their delicious spicy-brown goodness from molasses. This recipe is a trans-pecos region variation, it uses the non-traditional addition of cinnamon. You may wish to try also adding a bit of dry ground ginger, and you may use a milk wash instead of an egg wash.
To make the Grand Fudge Cake: Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Grease and lightly flour two 9-inch round cake pans. In a medium bowl, combine cocoa, flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt; set aside. In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar on medium-high speed until light and fluffy, about 4 minutes. Reduce speed to low, and add vanilla and eggs one at a time, scraping bowl after each addition. Alternately add flour mixture and milk (starting and ending with the flour mixture), while mixing on low speed. Continue to mix until smooth. Pour into prepared pans. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes or until a cake tester inserted in the center of cake comes out clean. To make the Ghirardelli Buttercream Frosting: In bowl, beat butter until light and fluffy. In a separate bowl, mix powdered sugar with cocoa. Blend sugar mixture with butter alternately with milk, beat well after each addition. Beat until smooth. Blend in vanilla. To make the Triple Chocolate Cake Pops: Crumble the Grand Fudge Cake into a very large bowl. Add the Ghirardelli Buttercream Frosting. Beat with an electric mixer on low speed until combined. Using a small scoop or spoon, drop the mixture into 1-1/2-inch mounds onto waxed paper-lined baking sheets. Roll mounds into balls and freeze for 30 minutes. In a small microwave-safe bowl, combine 1/4 cup of the Ghirardelli(R) 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips and 1/4 teaspoon of the shortening. Cook on medium power (50 percent) for 1 minute. Remove and stir until smooth. Dip one end of each lollipop stick into the melted chocolate and poke sticks into the cake balls (this helps the balls stay on the sticks). Freeze for 30 to 60 minutes or until balls are firm. In a small microwave-safe bowl, heat the Ghirardelli Classic White Chocolate Baking Chips on medium power (50 percent) for 1 minute. Remove and stir. If chocolate is not melted, return to microwave and repeat heating step, stirring every 30 seconds to avoid scorching. Stir until smooth. Set aside. Meanwhile, in a large microwave-safe bowl, combine the remaining Ghirardelli 60% Cacao Bittersweet Chocolate Baking Chips and the remaining shortening. Microwave on medium power (50 percent) for 2 minutes. Remove and stir. If chocolate is not melted, return to microwave and repeat heating step, stirring every 30 seconds to avoid scorching. Working in batches, dip the frozen balls into the melted bittersweet chocolate. Allow excess to drip off. When the bittersweet chocolate is just set, drizzle the pops with the melted white chocolate. Place on prepared baking sheets.* Let stand for 30 minutes or until chocolate is set. After chocolate is set, transfer to a storage container and store, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Let stand at room temperature for at least 30 minutes before serving.

An old friend christened this sauce in the sixties because back then I just added what felt right.  I still do, but after all these years, it's pretty much the same ingredients every time!  Be sure to remove bay leaves before serving. This sauce keeps for at least 2 weeks in the fridge. It's a great sauce for pasta, lasagna and pizza. If sauce tastes too acid from the tomatoes, a little instant coffee will tone down the acid, however, BE VERY CAREFUL. Too much of either will kill the taste of the sauce completely!

Beginning several days before you hope to be eating this bread, rinse 1/2 cup raw wheat berries in cool water; drain. Soak the berries with cool water in a large bowl. Cover the bowl with a plate or cloth, and allow the berries to soak at normal room temperature overnight or for about 12 hours. The berries will soak up a considerable amount of water. Drain the berries in a colander, cover the colander with a plate to prevent the berries from drying out, and set it in a place away from light. Rinse the berries about 3 times a day, and they will soon begin to sprout. In a couple of days the sprouts will reach their optimum length of about l/4 inch. Drain the sprouts and grind them in a blender or food processor. Place ingredients in the pan of the bread machine in the order recommended by the manufacturer. Select Whole Wheat cycle and Medium Crust setting; press Start. If your machine has a raisin cycle, you can put the sprouts in at the beep for more intact sprouts. If not, the bread may have a mushy consistency. It will take several days for the wheat berries to sprout before you can use them in this recipe. The reward for your patience is a hearty loaf packed with protein. Special care needs to be taken with this bread and the instructions need to be followed very carefully.
Mix minced onion, salt, chili powder, cornstarch, cumin, red pepper flakes, cayenne pepper, dried minced garlic, and oregano in a bowl. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into the hot skillet. Cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Return ground beef to heat. Pour seasoning mixture and water over the beef; stir to combine. Bring to a simmer and cook until the moisture absorbs into the meat, about 5 minutes. Taking just a little extra time to make this flavorful ground beef makes all the difference in your homemade tacos!
Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir the carrots, red onion, garlic, and salt and pepper until the onions are translucent, about 5 minutes.

This recipe may be cut in half for smaller families.
Blend ranch dressing, cilantro, jalapeno pepper, tomato, and avocado in a blender until smooth. Refrigerate for 2 hours before serving. A spicy twist on traditional ranch dressing. I use this on taco salads and as a dipping sauce for taquitos, mini-tacos, jalapeno poppers, etc. It's good with or without the avocado! Add more peppers to taste. I make a batch with habaneros for my father-in-law, too!
Heat a panini grill or waffle iron. Brush oil over bread slices. Turn 4 slices over; spread pesto evenly over bread. Top with half of the cheese, tearing to fit if necessary, all of the prosciutto and pepper strips and remaining cheese. Close sandwiches with remaining bread oiled sides up. Cook (in batches) in panini maker* or waffle iron 3 to 4 minutes or until golden brown and cheese is melted. The perfect flavor combo--prosciutto, Provolone, pesto, and roasted bell peppers--on rustic bread and toasted in a panini press makes a great lunch or a quick, light dinner.

Add sausage, salt, pepper; brown well until cooked through. (Optional) Deglaze sausage pan with wine and reduce. Add 2 jars marinara sauce to the sausage mixture, bring to a boil. Pour 1 cup marinara sauce on the bottom of prepared baking dish. Layer 3 sheets of lasagna noodles, top with 1 cup of sausage mixture, 1/2 cup ricotta and 2 tablespoons of Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Repeat for 3 more layers. On the top layer pour the remaining marinara sauce and cover with foil. Bake in pre-heated oven for 20 minutes. Top Lasagna with mozzarella and the remaining Parmigiano Reggiano cheese. Re-cover with foil and continue baking for another 10 minutes. Before cutting the lasagna let it rest for 5 minutes. Marinara sauce and sausage make a hearty addition to this lasagna with wavy noodles, ricotta, and Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese.
Heat a large saucepan or Dutch oven over medium heat. Add ground beef, and cook until evenly browned. Stir occasionally to crumble. Season the beef with chili powder, onion flakes, cumin, paprika, garlic and red pepper flakes, and mix well. Pour in the tomatoes, chili beans, and tomato sauce. Reduce heat to low, and simmer for at least 30 minutes, or longer for thicker chili. Season to taste with salt and pepper. This recipe is something I will whip together on nights when spaghetti just won't cut it, but time is a commodity worth more than gold. There are only two in my family, but that just means plenty of yummy leftovers. Serve this chili with cheese on top and a thick slice of homemade sourdough bread and you've got a winner. The measurements are approximations since I'm more of a shake and dab type of cook, but this is generally right. This gives more kick than you might think, so be lenient with the pepper flakes if you are serving kids!
Place the chicken broth and rice in a large pot. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low, cover and simmer for 15 minutes. During the last 5 minutes of the rice, melt the butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat until it browns and the foam starts to clear. It will be a dark brown, similar to chocolate. After the rice has simmered for the 15 minutes, remove it from the heat. Pour the burnt butter over it, being careful not to spatter. Do not stir into the rice. Replace the lid, and let stand for 15 minutes. Stir and season with salt to taste before serving. Awesome rice cooked in chicken broth, then topped with burnt butter!  A family favorite that me Greek Grandpa used to make!  My dad loves it with plain yogurt on top and my mother, with buttery tomato sauce.  Great with everything!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, combine the ground beef, sausage, bread crumbs, onion, mushrooms, soup and egg. Mix together well and place in a 5x9 inch loaf pan. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 50 minutes. A new twist on meatloaf. You can even try it with ground turkey. The sausage gives it a little oomph!
Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Melt butter with sesame oil in a skillet over medium heat. Season butter mixture with garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Cook and stir shrimp, cashews, and green chile peppers in the butter mixture until everything is hot and coated in butter, about 5 minutes. Arrange tortilla halves into a baking dish. Top each tortilla half with half the avocado slices. Spoon about half the shrimp mixture atop each portion of avocado, drizzling any remaining melted butter from the skillet over the mixture. Top each with about half the pepperjack cheese and Cheddar cheese. Cook under the preheated broiler until the cheese is bubbling and the edges of the tortilla browning, about 5 minutes. This is Mexican quesadilla-inspired recipe, with a twist. I also saute whole unsalted cashews with the dish. It's quite decadent! I make this on days when I have sufficiently exercised to offset the calories!   It's great as a low-carb dish, if you are not counting calories or fat! I count everything, so I make sure this is a special treat item.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Press pie crust into a 9-inch pie pan. Whisk pumpkin, sweetened condensed milk, and eggs together in a bowl until smooth, about 30 seconds. Add light brown sugar, nutmeg, cinnamon, and ginger; whisk until evenly combined. Pour mixture into prepared pie crust. Sprinkle pecans over filling. Place pie on a baking sheet and cover pie with a sheet of aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and remove aluminum foil. Roll aluminum foil into a flattened tube-shape and cover crust with aluminum foil. Bake for 30 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and bake until pie is set in the middle and crust is lightly browned, about 5 more minutes. I was out of evaporated milk so I came up with a different recipe. I hope you enjoy it.
Rinse and pat dry the chicken breasts, then place into the bottom of a slow cooker. Add the corn, tomatoes, chicken broth, enchilada sauce, green chiles, onion, cilantro, bay leaves, garlic, cumin, chili powder, salt, and black pepper. Cook on Low for 6 hours. Transfer the chicken to a large plate, then shred the meat with two forks. Return the chicken to the slow cooker and continue cooking for 30 minutes to 1 hour. A tasty, quick, hot meal! We like to top the bowls of soup with crushed corn tortilla chips, shredded cheese or chopped green onions -- sometimes all three.
Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a large bowl, beat the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Beat in the eggs, one at a time, mixing until smooth. Combine the flour, salt and baking powder, stir into the creamed mixture. Fold in the chopped walnuts and anise seed. Shape the dough into 4 or 5 rolls that are the same length as the cookie sheets. Place the rolls onto ungreased cookie sheets and flatten slightly. Bake for 15 to 20 minutes in the preheated oven, until just starting to brown. Remove from the oven and cool on wire racks. When the rolls are cool enough to handle, transfer them to a cutting board. Using a serrated knife, cut the rolls crosswise into 1 inch slices. Place the slices cut-side down on the cookie sheets and return to the oven for an additional 5 to 10 minutes more, until golden and crispy. These anise cookies are versatile and delicious. Oil can be used in place of margarine for a lower fat version.  Any type of nuts can also be used in place of the walnuts. These elegant twice baked cookies are perfect for company.
Mix pudding and peanut butter together in a bowl until smooth; add protein powder and stir. Fold in whipped topping until pie filling is combined. Pour filling into prepared pie crust. Freeze pie until firm, 8 hours to overnight. Thaw in the refrigerator for 2 hours before serving. Chocolate, peanut butter, and whipped cream, plus added protein!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Cook the macaroni according to directions on the box. Remove from heat, drain, and add soup, 1/4 cup of the margarine, sour cream, shredded cheese, and the cheese packet from the box. Do not use milk as directed on the box. Pour in a small casserole dish and top with crumbled crackers. Melt the remaining margarine and pour over the crackers.  Bake in a preheated oven for 25 minutes. This recipe is super-easy and it uses stuff you probably already have in the cabinet. You can also substitute most of the ingredients with similar ones that you have on hand!
Blend onions, green bell pepper, habanero pepper, and oil in a blender until creamy. Transfer the onion mixture to a stock pot. Add water, peanut butter, bouillon cubes, and salt to the onion mixture. Place a cover on the stock pot and bring the mixture to a boil; cook at a boil for 30 minutes. Stir the spinach into the boiling mixture; replace the cover on the stock pot and cook until the water has evaporated a bit and the sauce has the consistency of gravy, about 30 minutes more. This is my mother-in-law's recipe. She resides in Freetown, Sierra Leone. If you have trouble getting the consistency, simmer for a bit without the lid. Serve over rice or with bread.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook linguine at a boil until tender yet firm to the bite, about 11 minutes; rinse with cold water and drain. Stir linguine, mushrooms, cherry tomatoes, green pepper, red peppers, onion, and cucumber together in a large bowl. Blend sugar, vinegar, ketchup, onion powder, celery seed, Worcestershire sauce, salt, ground mustard, paprika, and garlic powder in a blender. Pour the vegetable oil in a steady stream into the blender while the mixture is blending. Mix a few seconds longer until the salad dressing is thick and creamy. Pour dressing over pasta mixture and toss to coat. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Great variation of a regular summer pasta salad!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a spice grinder or mortar, combine kosher salt, caraway seeds, sage, fennel, coriander, and rosemary. Grind to a coarse powder. Transfer spice mixture to a bowl and stir in paprika, garlic powder, flour, and onion powder; mix in vegetable oil to make a smooth paste. Pat chicken halves dry with paper towels and tuck wing tips up behind the back. Brush spice paste onto chicken halves, coating both sides, taking care to season under wings and legs. Place chicken halves in baking dish or roasting pan with skin sides up, leaving space around chicken so halves aren't touching. Roast in preheated oven until a thermometer inserted in a thigh reads 165 degrees F (74 degrees C), about 1 hour. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing. This oven-roasted chicken is inspired by the Brathaehnchen served commonly in Bavarian Biergartens, small shops, and food carts. You can serve this chicken with many side dishes, but favorites are fried potatoes or spaetzle and a nice garden salad. Weiss beer doesn't hurt at all!
Preheat the oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Coat a 16 inch pizza pan with nonstick cooking spray. Place sausage in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook, stirring to crumble, until evenly browned. Drain grease, and set aside. In a large bowl, toss together the hash browns, salt, and 3/4 cup of the cheese until evenly blended. Spread in an even layer on the pizza pan, and pack down. Slice tomatoes thinly, and set on paper towels to drain. This will keep them from being watery when they cook. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the crust is nicely browned on the top and bottom. Remove from the oven, and arrange tomato slices all over the pizza. Sprinkle the remaining cheese, mushrooms and sausage evenly over the pizza. Return to the hot oven and bake for another 5 to 10 minutes, until cheese is melted. Cool for at least 5 minutes before cutting into slices. Unique Pizza that uses hash brown potatoes for the crust, and is topped with sausage, tomatoes and mushrooms. Experiment with some of your other favorite toppings.
Mix sugar, cocoa powder, and salt in a microwave-safe mixing bowl. Pour milk over the sugar mixture. Arrange margarine pieces atop the mixture, but do not mix into it. Heat in microwave for 2 minutes. Stir the mixture thoroughly and heat for 1 minute more; stir again. Fold nuts into the chocolate mixture; add vanilla and stir. Grease an 8-inch glass baking dish with butter. Pour batter into the prepared dish. Freeze batter until set, about 20 minutes. Quick and always a welcome treat, this fudge is amazingly simple and will melt in your mouth with chocolate-y goodness!
Mix together the ginger, marmalade, garlic, soy sauce, brown sugar, hot sauce, and mustard. Stir in the beer. Prick holes all over the roast with a 2 pronged fork. Pour marinade over roast. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, basting at least twice. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Place roast on a rack in a roasting pan. Pour about 1 cup of marinade into the roasting pan, and discard remaining marinade. Pour olive oil over roast, and season with freshly ground black pepper. Insert a roasting thermometer into the middle of the roast, making sure that the thermometer does not touch any bone. Cover roasting pan with aluminum foil, and seal edges tightly around pan. Cook roast for 1 hour in the preheated oven. After the first hour, remove the aluminum foil. Baste, reduce heat to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C), and continue roasting for 1 more hour. The thermometer reading should be at least 140 degrees F (60 degrees C) for medium-rare, and 170 degrees F (76 degrees C) for well done. Remove roasting pan from oven, place aluminum foil over roast, and let rest for about 30 minutes before slicing. This very flavorful roast is appropriate for any special occasion. The marinade in this recipe tenderizes the roast and the leftovers make fantastic sandwiches.
Place the peelings and cores into a saucepan, and stir in the water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to a simmer, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the water picks up the apple flavor and color, about 30 minutes. Drain the apple juice, discarding solid pieces, and stir in the sugar until dissolved. Allow to cool before drinking. My mother had a creative way of using the apple cores and peels leftover from making apple pie: to make homemade apple juice. Store-bought apple juice is tasty, but it has a strong, distinct flavor with almost a hint of bitterness. To those with sensitive palates, it can be a little strong at times. Homemade juice, however, tastes surprisingly different as it is lighter and pleasantly sweet without the kick. Besides using a juicer, this is a super-easy way of making apple juice.
Squeeze the lemon halves into a large pot, and toss in the halves. Add the garlic, bay leaves, peppercorns, and salt, then fill with water to half full. Bring to a boil over high heat, then stir in the shrimp, and turn off the heat. Allow the shrimp to poach until they are no longer translucent in the center, 3 to 5 minutes. Drain in a colander in the sink, then place the shrimp on a baking sheet, and refrigerate until cold, about 30 minutes. Stir the coconut milk, lime juice, serrano peppers, chopped cilantro, and onion together in a non-metallic bowl; season with salt to taste. Cut the chilled shrimp in half lengthwise and stir into the coconut marinade. Cover and refrigerate 30 minutes before serving. Garnish individual servings with the cilantro sprigs and lime wedges. This is a simple take on ceviche. Instead of letting the shrimp 'cook' in citric acid, you boil them, then let them marinate in a rich and creamy coconut milk sauce. This is simple and refreshing for a nice summer day.
Mix flour, 2 tablespoons salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and onion powder in a bowl. Dredge beef short ribs in the seasoned flour mixture. Reserve 3 tablespoons of leftover seasoned flour. Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium-high heat and pan-fry the beef ribs until browned on all sides, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Remove ribs and set aside. Turn heat down to medium and melt butter in the pot; cook and stir sweet onions in the butter until soft and slightly browned, about 15 minutes. Stir constantly and reduce heat if onions begin to burn. Stir 3 tablespoons of reserved seasoned flour mixture into the onions and cook and stir for 10 minutes; pour in beef broth and sherry. Bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until soup is slightly thickened; season with more salt and black pepper, if desired. Strip leaves from thyme sprigs and add leaves to the soup. Gently return short ribs to the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer soup until ribs are tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Stir soup every hour or so. Preheat the oven's broiler. Ladle soup into oven-safe soup crocks, placing a short rib into each bowl. Top soup with 2 slices of French bread per bowl and sprinkle about 1/4 cup of Gruyere cheese over each crock. Place crocks under broiler until cheese is browned and bubbling, 2 to 3 minutes. Though I love French onion soup, this twist with beef short ribs adds great beef flavor and is a bit more hearty!   The crocks are something else to purchase, but at $30 for a set of four which are microwave-, oven-, and dishwasher-safe, and handy for all sorts of things, they are worth it.
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add peas, cover, and steam until tender, about 15 minutes. Place peas and breast milk in a blender or food processor and puree until creamy. Strain the mixture through a fine-mesh sieve to remove any lumps. Spread pea mixture into an ice cube tray, cover with plastic wrap and freeze until solid, 2 to 3 hours. Transfer frozen cubes to a resealable plastic bag and store in the freezer. To serve, heat cubes in the microwave for about 30 seconds until warm but not hot. Stir thoroughly. Great for busy moms and dads to make a bunch on a Sunday and freeze for the weeks ahead. This can be used with other first foods for your baby! Apples or pears are fun or even green beans. Make sure it is mild enough for your baby's developing digestive system. Brussels sprouts or broccoli probably aren't the best first foods. You can also use fresh peas instead of frozen if you have them.
Set a heavy skillet over medium heat and pour olive oil into the skillet. Cook and stir garlic and shallot in the hot oil until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add smoked turkey to skillet; cook and stir until heated, about 1 minute. Pour heavy cream into the skillet and raise heat to medium-high; bring sauce to a boil. Season with salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until sauce has thickened slightly, about 5 minutes. Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in the fettuccine, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, 7 to 8 minutes. Drain. Turn heat under cream sauce to low and stir in peas; toss fettuccine with sauce until coated. Mix in tarragon and lemon zest and cook until flavors have blended, about 1 minute. Adjust seasonings if desired. Serve in bowls and sprinkle each serving with about 3/4 teaspoon Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese for garnish. This rich and creamy smoked turkey and spring pea fettuccine recipe is inspired by a pasta I learned long ago working at my first real chef job in San Francisco. There's just something very special about the way the creamy, slightly sweet, aromatic sauce pairs with the smoky meat.
For crust, combine graham cracker crumbs, 1/3 cup sugar, ground walnuts, cinnamon, and melted butter. Press onto bottom and part way up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Chill crust while preparing filling. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat cottage cheese in small mixing bowl with an electric mixer on high speed until almost smooth, about 5 minutes; set aside. Beat cream cheese in large mixing bowl until light and fluffy. On medium speed, beat in Swiss cheese and cottage cheese until well-blended, about 3 minutes. Mix in 1 cup sugar, vanilla, almond extract, and salt. Beat in egg yolks, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Gradually blend in flour. Wash egg beaters well, so no trace of batter remains. In a separate bowl, beat egg whites until medium-stiff peaks form. Lift the beater straight up: the tip of the peak formed by the egg whites should curl over slightly. Fold 1/3 of the egg white mixture into the cheesecake batter to lighten; fold in remaining egg whites. Pour batter into prepared crust. Bake in preheated oven until center is set and doesn't jiggle when pan is shaken gently, 60 to 65 minutes. Turn oven heat off. Open oven door and let cheesecake cool in oven. It is normal for the cake to sink slightly in center. Refrigerate several hours or overnight. Place cake on serving plate; carefully remove sides of pan. For glaze, place pear slices in a decorative pattern on top of cheesecake. Heat currant jelly in small saucepan over low heat, stirring constantly, until melted. Spoon small amount over pear slices until all slices are coated; reserve remaining jelly. Refrigerate glazed cake at least one hour. To serve, reheat jelly and spoon a small amount over each slice of cheesecake. A different cheesecake--made with Swiss cheese.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet with non-stick cooking spray. Stem the mushrooms. Reserve 1/3 to 1/2 of the stems and mince them. Whip the cream cheese until smooth. In a small bowl, combine minced mushroom stems and crabmeat. Blend the cream cheese into the stem and clam mixture. Add garlic salt and mix well. Stuff the mushroom caps with the cheese mixture. Arrange the caps on the prepared baking sheet. Bake mushrooms at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 20 minutes, or until the mushrooms and crab mixture are hot, and most of the liquid from the mushrooms has collected in the pan. Incredibly easy and taste even better!  There are never any left over!
Boil sweet potato whole in skin for 40 to 50 minutes, or until done.  Run cold water over the sweet potato, and remove the skin. Break apart sweet potato in a bowl.  Add butter, and mix well with mixer. Stir in sugar, milk, eggs, nutmeg, cinnamon and vanilla. Beat on medium speed until mixture is smooth.  Pour filling into an unbaked pie crust. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 55 to 60 minutes, or until knife inserted in center comes out clean.  Pie will puff up like a souffle, and then will sink down as it cools. This recipe was shared with me by a special friend in Atlanta, Ga.  It has long been a favorite, and everyone who tastes it says it is the best they have ever had.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease a 2 quart casserole dish. Combine broccoli, onions and cheese in prepared dish. In a small bowl whisk together baking mix, egg, milk, salt and pepper.  Pour over broccoli mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 35 minutes, or until lightly browned. This is good hot or cold.
In a saucepan over medium heat, mix together butter, tarragon vinegar, flour and egg. Stirring continuously, heat 10 minutes, or until the mixture begins to thicken. Remove from heat and allow to cool 10 minutes. In a large bowl, prepare the sauce by combining the tarragon vinegar mixture with mayonnaise. Place eggs in a medium saucepan and cover with cold water. Bring water to a boil and immediately remove from heat. Cover and let eggs stand in hot water for 10 to 12 minutes. Remove from hot water, cool, peel and chop. Bring a large saucepan of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the macaroni 10 minutes, or until al dente. Drain and pour  into the bowl with the sauce. Stir until the macaroni is well coated. Mix the coated macaroni with the eggs, cucumber, tomato, green bell pepper and salt. A macaroni salad that utilizes tarragon vinegar for a delicious tangy taste. For optimum flavor, chill the salad 2 hours in the refrigerator before serving.
Slice tofu block into 3 long slabs lengthwise.  Wrap each slab in paper towels, and press to squeeze out excess water. Coat a large skillet with cooking spray, and then add 2 teaspoons sesame oil.  Once the oil is hot, add the tofu slabs to the skillet. Fry for about 5 minutes on each side, or until delicately browned. Remove tofu from skillet, and slice into cubes. Add the remaining teaspoon sesame oil to the skillet, and stir fry the water chestnuts, mushrooms and snow peas. Mix together water and oyster sauce, and add to the skillet along with the tofu. Cover, and cook over low heat for about 10 minutes. I love the braised tofu served at Chinese restaurants, but at home I like to make it healthier (without the deep frying). In my version, I use a lot of vegetables to make it more filling for a lot less calories. This dish is good both over rice or stand alone.
Whisk anchovies, rosemary, olive oil, vinegar, and garlic together in a large bowl; pour into a resealable plastic bag. Season pork chops with coarse salt and ground black pepper; add to the plastic bag with the marinade, squeeze out as much air from bag as possible, and seal. Turn bag a few times to assure chops are coated in marinade. Marinate chops in refrigerator at least 2 hours. Set oven rack about 6 inches from the heat source and preheat the oven's broiler. Prepare a jelly roll pan with cooking spray. Remove pork chops from the marinade and shake off excess moisture. Discard the remaining marinade. Cook under the broiler until no longer pink in the center, 6 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). This unusual pairing caught my eye one day in an old cookbook of my mother's which I was reading. I love those three ingredients but I wasn't too sure I'd like them together. Well, I'll leave that to you but my finicky husband asked me what made those chops taste soooo good!
Combine the basil, rosemary, parsley, sea salt, black pepper, sage, thyme, marjoram, oregano, celery salt, and garlic powder in a mixing bowl until evenly blended. Store in an airtight container. I wanted a really easy way to fix fish, so I came up with this recipe.  Just mix it up and store in your pantry.  Season fish, then either bake or grill.  I like to mix it with a little olive oil and spread over salmon filets, then bake it in the oven. This blend of herbs goes really well with fish, yet does not overpower it.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Cook broccoli in a large pot of salted boiling water until just slightly tender. Drain.

The classic cheeseburger gets a tasty update with the addition of GOYA® Chipotle Peppers in Adobo Sauce. These chipotle chiles are jalapeno peppers that have been dried, smoked, and then packed in a flavorful sauce made of tomatoes and other spices. Here, we add these special peppers twice--first to the mayonnaise, which gets spread on the buns, and then mixed into the meat before its grilled. And don't skip the red onions and tomatoes: they add a sweet, crisp bite.
In a large glass or ceramic bowl, gently toss the shrimp and scallops with the lime juice and lemon juice. Mix in onion, cucumber, tomato, jalapeno, serrano, cilantro, olive oil, salt, and pepper.

Remove meat from grill, and allow to rest for 5 minutes before slicing into 1/4 inch thick medallions. This is my favorite summer marinade for pork tenderloin. Use any of your favorite fruit sodas--black cherry, grape,  raspberry, etc. Also great served cold on a green salad.
Combine the milk, butter, and sugar together in a saucepan and bring to a boil; allow to cook at a rolling boil for 30 seconds and immediately remove from heat.

(Freeze remaining tortillas for future green sauce enchiladas!) Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. These are the best chicken enchiladas you will ever have! I created this recipe one day by accident, and it's now a family favorite. Try it, you won't be disappointed!

This end product is a little lighter, and the recipe is a little more in-depth then some of the other recipes available. It will allow you to tailor some of the ingredients more to your taste. There have been many variations of this liqueur, but this one is the most accurate to store brands of Irish cream. It is also the most flexible. Store brands do not use Hershey's® chocolate syrup in their recipe. This one should have a better consistency and taste a little more proper to the famous brand 'B' from Ireland if followed directly. You be the judge.

Cook the mixture until reduced and thickened, 3 to 5 minutes; spoon the balsamic sauce over each chicken breast to serve. My aunt made this for Christmas Eve one year -- it's fantastic! I tweaked her recipe just a bit to my taste, and cooked this meal for a date night. We have been together ever since! Adjust the garlic and vinegar to your liking. I happen to believe that garlic should be included in every meal,so I tend to add more depending on my mood. Don't be put off by the smell of the vinegar. As it cooks down, it becomes sweet and not as strong. Your nose may tell you otherwise! I serve a Pinot Grigio and rice pilaf with this dish to round out the meal.

In the spirit of fall here in the Pacific Northwest, here is a recipe of my friend Joe's own design! He sought to bring bacon to the dessert menu, and hunted for a pie media capable of sustaining a bacon infusion while retaining deliciousness. Pumpkin (perhaps rhubarb) is the only one he could think of. I offer this recipe to all you bacon lovers out there. Remember though, you might steal this recipe to publish it and make dirty millions, but the true bacon lover cares not for cash but only for cholesterol. Enjoy bacon lovers of America!
Place the eggplant slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with salt. Let drain over a bowl in the refrigerator for at least an hour. I like to do this overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook for about 6 minutes, or until almost tender. It will cook the rest of the way in the oven. Drain. Mix together the ricotta cheese and eggs in a small bowl. Stir in half of the mozzarella cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese. Spread a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange layers of eggplant, cheese, ziti pasta, and more sauce all the way to the top of the pan. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and cheese is lightly browned. I come from a big Italian family, my mom made this all the time.  Very delicious and very hardy.  A great anytime meal. The secret to good eggplant is to peel and drain it, so it's not soggy.  Serve with crusty italian bread, and a tossed salad, and you have a hearty meal.  It seems like a lot of work but it's not.  I hope you enjoy your meal.

Beat egg whites until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl. Continue to beat until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Use a rubber spatula or wire whisk to gently fold 1/3 of the egg whites into the batter, keeping as much volume as possible. Add the remaining egg whites, folding just until incorporated. Pour half of the batter into a separate bowl. Sift the cocoa powder into one bowl of batter. Stir until just combined.

The salami should keep the cheese from leaking out when grilling. Preheat on outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Place the peppers legs side up on the hot grill. Turn occasionally after a minute or two as the meat begins to crisp up, and the skin on the peppers is starting to blister. When it is evenly browned the toothpicks will have turned black like six little legs sticking out - hence the name cucarachas. Allow the peppers to cool slightly, then remove toothpicks and enjoy!

Very simple and easy, but very good.
Fold each sheet of aluminum foil in half lengthwise, then fold in half lengthwise again, to make 2 strips of foil 4 inches wide by 16 inches long. Place the strips into the bottom of a slow cooker in a cross, so that the long ends of the strips come partway up the inside of the cooker (to make lifting handles). Spray the inside of the slow cooker and the foil strips with cooking spray. Mix together the ground beef, pork sausage, egg whites, grits, onion powder, garlic powder, ketchup, and liquid smoke flavoring until thoroughly combined, and form into a rounded loaf. Gently place the loaf into the slow cooker on top of the crossed foil strips. Cover the cooker, set on Low, and cook for 5 to 6 hours. To serve, carefully hold the ends of the foil strips, and gently lift the meat loaf from the cooker by the foil handles to place on a serving platter for slicing. With this recipe you can enjoy a taste of sausage and grits in a meatloaf. This recipe uses the grits as a binder instead of the bread crumbs used in a traditional meatloaf recipe.  The slow cooking method results in a firm yet moist meatloaf that not only tastes great for dinner, but can be thinly sliced for next day lunch sandwiches. Use your favorite barbecue sauce instead of ketchup, if you prefer. Serve alone, with gravy, with ketchup or BBQ sauce.    Makes great sandwiches cold or warmed in a buttered fry pan.

Sift together the flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and espresso powder; stir into the creamed mixture. Finally, stir in the chocolate chips. Drop dough by heaping tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet. Cookies should be 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart. You should have 12 to 15 large cookies. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. For crispier cookies, bake 2 minutes longer. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. This is the famous Neiman Marcus Chocolate Chip Cookie Recipe. There has been a myth that someone was charged $250 for the recipe, but that was never true. This is now their official cookie recipe, and it's free to everyone.

Stirring constantly, bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat, and cook until thick, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool. On a floured surface, unroll the pie crusts, and roll each crust out to an 11-inch circle. Cut each crust into 18 rectangles about 1 1/2-inch by 2 inches. Place 18 squares onto the prepared baking sheet about 1 inch apart, and place a wooden pop stick onto each square so that about 1 inch of the stick is on the dough rectangle. Spoon about 1 teaspoon of the cherry filling into center of each dough rectangle. Top each tart with a second rectangle of dough, and crimp the edges of the little tarts with a fork. Press dough around stick to help hold the stick in place. Bake in the preheated oven until the tarts are lightly browned at the edges, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool. Make the glaze by stirring confectioners' sugar with milk and vanilla extract until smooth and pourable (not thin). Spread a coating of glaze over each tart, and sprinkle the tarts with candy sprinkles. Allow the glaze to set for several hours before serving. These cherry mini toaster tarts are much better than the store-bought version. You can make them as pops or make them regular-sized. The kids love these!

Mix the bread crumbs and cheese in a shallow dish. Spread both sides of turkey with sour cream and press into the bread crumb mixture to coat. Heat the oil in a skillet over medium heat. Place turkey in the skillet and cook 5 to 7 minutes on each side, until lightly browned and cooked through. I came up with this thinking of a different way to serve the turkey breast. The sour cream seals in the moisture and no one would ever guess that it's in there. A great new way to try turkey. This is my husband's new favorite turkey dish.

Let cool before serving. Caramel corn with roasted peanuts and chocolate. This will take a while to make, but is well worth it!
Heat oil in deep-fryer to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Whisk together the egg, milk, and 2 teaspoons of vegetable oil in a bowl until smooth. Stir in the pancake mix until no dry lumps remain. Dip the cookies into the batter one at a time, and carefully place into the hot frying oil. Fry only 4 or 5 at a time to avoid overcrowding the deep fryer. Cook until the cookies are golden-brown, about 2 minutes. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate before serving. This is a carnival favorite where I grew up. Oreos get dipped into pancake batter and fried - yummy!! You can do this with or without a deep fryer.
Heat the broth and potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes well in a colander, reserving the broth. Mash the potatoes with the reserved broth, the cream and butter. Season to taste. The secret to making these potatoes extra-flavorful is cooking them in chicken broth. They're mashed until perfectly smooth and creamy, with just the right amount of butter and cream to make a savory side everyone will enjoy.

Continue kneading until smooth, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl, and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Lightly grease a cookie sheet. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the marzipan into a rope and place it in the center of the dough. Fold the dough over to cover it; pinch the seams together to seal. Place the loaf, seam side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes, then reduce heat to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C), and bake for a further 30 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. Allow loaf to cool on a wire rack. Dust the cooled loaf with confectioners' sugar, and sprinkle with the cinnamon. I got this recipe while I was head baker at London's Dorchester Hotel. It's packed with dried fruit and filled with a marzipan surprise.

Stir seasoning from ramen noodles, soy sauce, garlic powder, and ground ginger into the vegetable and noodle mixture; toss to combine. Cook and stir until hot, about 1 minute. Cheap and easy alternative to take out. Our kid loves ramen noodles, so this is a great way to make him eat his veggies without him even realizing it! You could make this with chicken, beef, or pork as well, just use the corresponding ramen soup flavor. I'm sure that a lot of people would also add sesame oil for more authentic flavor, but I find sesame oil overpowering (personal preference).
Toss pear slices with 1/4 cup white sugar, lemon juice, and lemon zest to coat. Arrange butter in a 12-inch cast-iron skillet and place on the center rack of the oven. Heat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Remove skillet from oven once the butter has just melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Beat eggs in a large bowl until frothy; add milk, 1/4 cup white sugar, vanilla extract, and salt and mix until just combined. Sift flour into egg mixture and stir until batter is just mixed.

Heat 1/4 inch of oil in a large heavy skillet over medium heat. When the oil is hot, drop rounded spoonfuls of batter into the skillet. Fry on each side until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes per side. Drain on paper towels and serve hot. A popular Jamaican appetizer. Just stamp them out in the kitchen, take some for the road and go! Saltcod can be prepared the day before for a quicker cook time. These are also good served with a spicy dipping sauce.
Place a large skillet over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into skillet; add onion and celery. Cook and stir beef mixture until beef is completely browned, 7 to 10 minutes.

Heat a griddle or large frying pan to medium-hot, and place 1 tablespoon of butter, margarine or oil into it. Let the butter melt before spooning the batter into the frying pan, form 4 inch pancakes out of the batter. Once bubbles form on the top of the pancakes, flip them over, and cook them on the other side for about 3 minutes. Continue with this process until all of the batter has been made into pancakes. These are delicious buckwheat pancakes that taste great with some butter and syrup or jam.

In a large saucepan on medium-low heat, combine wine, sugar, and cinnamon. Cut the orange in half, push the cloves into the outside of the orange halves, and place them into the wine. Heat slowly on low heat for about 30 minutes or until steaming; do not let it boil. Heat your glasses in warm water before serving. Bisschopswijn, meaning 'bishop's wine,' is the Dutch version of the German Gluehwein, a hot drink for snowy holidays that makes you glow inside. Don't drink this if you have to drive tonight! Each household has its own variety; this is the one my Dutch neighbors used to make when I was a kid in Amsterdam for Christmas and New Year's Eve.

Chili paste with soy bean oil comes in small jars and can be found in most Asian markets. Galangal,  a member of the ginger family, is a knobby root that tastes like a cross between ginger and pepper. Tom Yum Soup paste can be found in Asian shops, or you can use Thai Red Curry paste. Kaffir lime leaves have an aromatic citrus-like smell and flavor. Garnish with fresh coriander leaves.
Prepare a large skillet with cooking spray and heat over medium heat. Smear 1 1/2 teaspoon peanut butter onto 1 side of each tortilla in a thin layer to cover.

Cook quesadillas in hot skillet until lightly browned and chocolate chips have melted, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Perfect, easy follow-up for any Mexican meal.
Heat vegetable oil in a heavy skillet over medium heat. Stir sugar into vegetable oil with a wooden spoon, stirring constantly until mixture is a light caramel-color, about 10 minutes. Mixture will be very hot. Stir onion, salt, and black pepper into sugar mixture. Onions will immediately start to caramelize. Stir frequently over medium heat until sugar has dissolved and onions are browned, about 15 minutes. Pour red wine vinegar into onion mixture and simmer until mixture has a jam consistency, about 30 minutes. Let cool to serve. A family favorite. Expect a few wrinkled noses maybe at the title, but result is worth the effort. Maybe not for beginning cooks since there's a couple potentially tricky steps. Serve a cup of jam over a bar of cream cheese with crackers, or as a spread for meat sandwiches. Keep in refrigerator in covered container for up to two weeks.
Blend buttermilk, mayonnaise, cilantro, tomatillo, lime juice, jalapeno pepper, ranch dressing mix, garlic, and black pepper together in a blender until smooth. Refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 1 hour. This recipe is similar to one that we enjoy at our favorite fast food salad place. We also use this as a dip for chicken nuggets. If dressing is too thick, thin it with a little milk.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a medium bowl, cream together the brown sugar and shortening until smooth.

Line a baking sheet with a silicone mat or parchment paper. Place yeast into bowl of a large stand mixer; whisk 1/2 cup flour and water into yeast until mixture is smooth. Let stand until mixture is foamy, 10 to 15 minutes. Whisk egg, 3 tablespoons melted butter, sugar, and salt into yeast mixture; add remaining flour and stir. Fit a dough hook onto stand mixer and knead the dough on low speed until soft and sticky, 5 to 6 minutes. Scrape sides if needed. Poke and prod the dough with a silicone spatula; if large amounts of dough stick to the spatula, add a little more flour. Transfer dough onto a floured work surface; dough will be sticky and elastic but not stick to your fingers. Form the dough lightly into a smooth, round shape, gently tucking loose ends underneath. Wipe out stand mixer bowl, drizzle olive oil into the bowl, and turn dough over in the bowl several times to coat surface thinly with oil. Cover bowl with aluminum foil. Let dough rise in a warm place until doubled in size, about 2 hours. Transfer dough to a floured work surface and form into a 5x10-inch rectangle about 1/2-inch thick. Cut dough into 8 equal lengths. Turn each slice cut-side up and form into a hot dog bun shape about 5 inches long. Transfer dough, cut-sides up, to the prepared baking sheet about set them about 1/4-inch apart. Cut a slit about 1/8-inch deep down the center of each bun. Brush 2 tablespoons melted butter over the top and sides of each bun. Let rise until almost doubled in size and the buns have risen into each other, about 45 minutes. Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake buns in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Brush tops with remaining melted butter. Don't get me wrong; if you hand me a hot dog at the ball game, it's not like I'm going to throw it back in your face, but given the choice this butter-crisped, split-topped bun is the way to go. Thanks to its genius design the meat and fixings go in the top, which leaves three relatively flat sides to toast in butter.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat, and cook the celery and shallots until shallots are tender. Pour half-and-half into a large pot over medium-high heat. Mix in the butter, celery, and shallot mixture. Stir continuously. When the mixture is almost boiling, pour the oysters and their liquid into the pot. Season with salt, pepper, and cayenne pepper. Stir continuously until the oysters curl at the ends. When the oysters curl the stew is finished cooking; turn off the heat and serve. This is best Oyster Stew you ever had! It is elegant and satisfying. I serve it with toasted homemade bread. Serve it quick and hot! Try adding a drop or two of hot sauce in your stew -- it's delicious!

Remove from the heat, season with salt and pepper to taste, and sprinkle with finely sliced basil leaves and crumbled goat cheese. I came up with this summer side dish when we discovered a couple of very large zucchini hiding in the garden.  I sometimes add some cooked chicken to make a nice one-pan entree.  If you don't like goat cheese, try subbing feta or a good Parmesan.

Mix in eggs, 2 teaspoons vanilla, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Beat thoroughly.  Mix in flour and chopped pecans. Drop tablespoons of dough onto ungreased baking sheets. Bake for 10 minutes in the preheated oven, or until light brown around the edges. Cool. In a medium bowl, mix the reserved 1/2 cup browned butter with 2 teaspoons vanilla, confectioners' sugar, and hot water. Beat until smooth, and use to frost cooled cookies. Using butter (NOT margarine) is essential for the success of this rich, but highly addictive cookie!  You may need as little as 3 cups confectioners' sugar for the icing; just stop adding it when you've reached the desired consistency.
Have ready 2 (12 ounce) canning jars. Put the instant coffee into a food processor, and process to  a fine powder. If you don't have a food processor, put it into a large plastic bag, and crush with a rolling pin. In a large bowl, combine creamer, chocolate mix, instant coffee, sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Stir together until well mixed. Spoon into 2 - 12 ounce jars. Attach a note to each jar that reads: Cappuccino:  Mix 3 tablespoons of powder with 6 fluid ounces hot water. Cappuccino mix that can be placed in a jar. It makes a great gift to go along with cookies in a jar! It could also be used in a fundraiser.
Using a whisk attachment on the mixer, whip heavy cream until stiff peaks form. Remove from mixer, and hand whisk in the sour cream and confectioners' sugar until just combined. Store in refrigerator. A tasty alternative to the real thing. Heavy cream is lightly sweetened, whipped until stiff, and mixed with a little sour cream for flavor. Serve with scones or fruit.
Heat a large skillet over medium high heat and add olive oil. Swirl to coat. Add the onion and saute until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Add the sausage, red pepper, and mushrooms; saute until meat is cooked through, about 5 minutes. Stir in the Ragu(R) Old World Style(R) Traditional sauce, broken lasagna noodles, water, and rosemary. Cover and turn heat down to medium-low. Cook for 20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the pasta is al dente.  Remove the lid and add the ricotta, 2/3 of the cheese, and parsley; stir to combine. Top with remaining mozzarella and serve immediately. Lasagna with sausage, mushrooms, and lots of cheese is fast and easy on the stove top--and there's no compromise on flavor.
Place the rice and 2 cups water in a pot, and bring to a boil. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer 45 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.

Cook 5 minutes, or until tender. Mix into the rice. Heat remaining olive oil in a skillet. Rub tuna with remaining 1/4 teaspoon pepper and salt. Place tuna in the skillet, and cook to desired doneness. Set aside, and keep warm. Place shallots in skillet. Increase heat to high, and pour in 3/4 cup water. Cook until liquid is reduced to about 1/2 cup, then stir in chives, orange zest and orange juice. Arrange fish over the rice and drizzle with the sauce to serve. A simply delicious meal! Sure to make your kitchen smell amazing! This recipe is very versatile, as well.  For example, you may find it easier to use lima beans instead of edamame. Also you could use a different type of fish if you don't like tuna. You could even use fresh herbs for a burst of flavor! Feel free to experiment. Enjoy!
Spread chicken into the crock of a slow cooker. Stir honey, soy sauce, ketchup, minced onion, vegetable oil, and garlic powder together in a bowl; pour over the chicken. Cook on Low until the chicken is tender, 3 to 4 hours. Remove chicken from the sauce in the slow cooker to a cutting board. Stir water and cornstarch together to dissolve cornstarch completely; pour into the sauce in the slow cooker until smooth. Cook on High until slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Cut chicken into bite-size pieces and stir into the sauce. Sprinkle sesame seeds over the chicken and sauce mixture. On busy crazy days, it is soooo nice to come home to this. Serve over rice.

Simmer for 5 minutes. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until tender. Drain. Mix cornstarch with a small amount of water, and stir into the skillet with the sauce. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until thick enough to coat the pasta. Serve sauce over pasta with freshly grated Parmesan cheese. So this is my favorite Italian dish.  I would take this any time over anything with red sauce.  I could get this whenever I wanted when I lived in NJ, but now that I'm in PA, it's not so easy.  So this is what I came up with as a replacement.  I'm not sure how authentic it is, but it's good!
Melt butter with olive oil in a large soup pot over medium heat. Cook and stir zucchini, celery, onion, red bell pepper, carrots, and garlic in the hot butter and oil until vegetables are soft, 8 to 10 minutes.

Cook and stir the filling until it thickens, 5 to 8 more minutes. Divide one of the packages of Mexican-style cheese among the tortillas. Spoon zucchini-squash filling into each tortilla, over the cheese, in a line down the center. Roll up the tortillas, and place them into the prepared baking dish with the seam sides down. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted and the tortillas are heated through, about 15 minutes. Sprinkle the other package of shredded cheese over the tortillas before serving. An easy recipe to throw together with your summer squash.  Can be tailored to your tastes and fresh vegetables on hand.  Great new way to use up summer squash from your garden or farmer's market. You can add fresh chopped cilantro to mixture before spooning into tortillas for a stronger flavored dish. Serve with sour cream, avocado, or salsa. 
In a large bowl, beat together eggs, carton sour cream, and salt.  Stir in flour and warm water. Add water until dough feels like velvet.  Turn out onto a lightly floured board, and knead until smooth.  Roll out to a 1/8 to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut out 3 1/2 inch circles with either the top of a glass or a  biscuit cutter. Cover with waxed paper to prevent drying out if not filling immediately. Place 1 or 2 tablespoons filling on one side of a circle of dough. Fold over, and seal by pressing the edges with a fork.  Repeat until ingredients are used. Bring a large pot of water to a boil.  Immerse pierogi.  Cook until the dumplings float to the surface. A delicious filled dumpling made from fresh pasta. These take time, but are so worth it!   Fill with Sauerkraut Filling or Potato and Cheese Filling. To freeze, place uncooked pierogies in melted butter. Cool, and place in freezer bags.  The butter will keep them from sticking.
In a large bowl, beat the cream, raspberry liqueur, vanilla extract, and confectioners' sugar together with an electric mixer until the mixture forms stiff peaks. Cut the cream cheese into pieces, and beat into the whipped cream mixture until fully combined. Layer half the pound cake slices into the bottom of a 9x9-inch square dish. Spoon half the raspberries and syrup onto the pound cake slices, and smooth on half the whipped cream mixture. Top with the remaining pound cake slices, remaining raspberries and syrup, and the rest of the whipped cream topping. Cover and refrigerate at least 1 hour. Serve cold. Lemon, raspberries, and raspberry liqueur replace the traditional coffee liqueur and espresso in this quick tiramisu look-a-like recipe. Top with fresh raspberries, lemon candies, or raspberry syrup. 
Pour the cranberry juice, vodka, schnapps, and lime juice into a cocktail shaker over ice. Cover, and shake until the outside of the shaker has frosted. Strain into a chilled martini glass to serve. I was making a Cosmo for myself and I didn't have any triple sec, so I used peach schnapps and loved it.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Spread butter generously over the lamb, and distribute garlic clove halves over the meat. Sprinkle with rosemary and pepper. Place the lamb on a rack inside a roasting pan. Roast the lamb in the preheated oven for 1 hour. Mix the lemonade concentrate and dry soup mix together in a bowl, pour over the lamb, and roast an additional 30 minutes. A meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the lamb should read 120 degrees F/58 degrees C for medium-rare or 145 degrees F/68 degrees C for medium-well. Allow the roast to stand for about 20 minutes before slicing. This recipe is great on the grill.  Dad uses a grill pan, and cooks according to oven directions. Usually the ham is in the oven so the grill works for us. A wonderful addition for Easter. The lamb and ham taste wonderful together. Source: Mom and Dad.

To Make Dough: In a large bowl sift together flour, salt and baking powder; cut in margarine. In a small bowl, slightly beat milk and eggs together. Combine egg mixture with dry ingredients; mix together until dough is formed. To Make Crust: Divide dough into two parts. Take one part and roll between sheets of floured wax paper; rolled dough should fit a jelly roll pan allowing for slight overhang on edges. Roll remaining half in the same fashion. Transfer one of the rolled dough halves to pan and spread with cooled filling. Place other portion of rolled dough on top of the filling and crimp edges of dough layers together. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 40 minutes or until golden brown. Let cool. If desired, frost with confectioners' icing. This is a pie baked on a jelly-roll pan. Great for a large family gathering.
Pour grape and orange soda into a punch bowl. Scoop small portions of lime sherbet into the soda mixture. Let the sherbet melt into a foamy green layer on top. Disgusting-looking punch for children's Halloween parties. Very easy and inexpensive. It is hard to convince kids to drink it, but they love it once they've tried it. It's too sweet for most adults. It helps that we live on a lake and say we've just drawn it from the lake.

Heat the olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Stir in the onions, celery, and potatoes. Cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 10 minutes. Pour in the wine, lemon juice, and bay leaf. Bring to a boil over high heat and boil until the wine has reduced by half. Pour in the chicken broth and bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer partially covered for 40 minutes until the vegetables are very tender. Remove the bay leaf and discard. Pour the soup into a blender, filling the pitcher no more than halfway full. Hold down the lid of the blender with a folded kitchen towel, and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth and pour into a clean pot. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup right in the cooking pot. Once pureed, stir in the thyme, basil, and parsley. Return to a simmer over medium heat and cook for 5 minutes to infuse the flavor of the herbs. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving. This soup is light, delicious and so easy to make.

Seal jar, and let stand in refrigerator overnight. Skim off the cooled layer of fat from the top before eating. An old family recipe from Bohemia for pickled pig's feet cooked with ham hock, onion, vinegar and spices.
Fill a rocks glass with ice; add rum and schnapps. Top drink with cola. This drink is a little dangerous since it goes down so easily, tasting just like a root beer soda.
In a bowl, lightly mix the Swiss cheese, green onions, banana peppers, jalapeno peppers, and mayonnaise. Cover and refrigerate 24 hours to blend flavors. Mix in more mayonnaise before serving, if desired. To serve, cut core out of cabbage and discard. Cut a thick slice from the bottom of the cabbage; use a fork to pull the inner leaves out of the cabbage to leave a hollowed out bowl. Pull several of the outer leaves slightly open and fold them back to make the bowl more attractive; serve the chilled dip in the hollowed cabbage. Festive appetizer served in hollowed out whole red cabbage -- accompanied by corn chips! Beautiful, easy, and oh so tasty! Especially pretty for Thanksgiving and Christmas appetizer buffets. Best if made ahead at least 24 hours to let flavors blend (can refrigerate in covered container for up to one week). Even with peppers, this dip is not too spicy -- children love this dip. A winner!

Season with Italian-style seasoning, garlic powder and sage and saute for another 10 minutes, until chicken is almost cooked through and juices run clear. Pour tomatoes and liquid over chicken, then add gravy mix and wine and stir all together. Reduce heat to low and simmer for about 20 minutes. Serve hot over cooked rice, if desired. Italian style chicken over rice in a thick, tomato gravy that contains some red wine. This one's simple, yet will be a big hit.
Season steaks with salt and pepper and place in a slow cooker; add onion, 1/2 cup water, bouillon, and dill. Cook on Low until steaks are tender, about 6 hours. Remove steaks from broth and place on a serving platter. Whisk 1/4 cup cold water and flour together in a bowl until smooth; pour into broth. Increase slow cooker heat to High and cook gravy until thickened, about 10 minutes. Stir sour cream into thickened gravy; serve alongside steaks. This is a variation of beef stroganoff. The dill gives it a wonderful flavor. The meat melts in your mouth, and it's so easy to make; serve over mashed potatoes or noodles.
Trim the brisket of most of the visible fat, and place in a slow cooker. Pour in beef broth, white wine and olive oil. Season with seasoning salt, allspice, peppercorns, garlic, onion flakes, red pepper flakes and the bay leaf. Cover, and cook on Low for 3 to 4 hours or until the roast is fork tender. Remove the roast to a serving platter. Stir together the cornstarch and cold water; mix into the juices in the slow cooker. Set to High, and cook for just a few minutes until thickened. Remove bay leaf, and serve as a gravy over the roast. A mildly spicy broth makes this beef brisket recipe so good! Slice and serve with hot egg noodles.
In a large bowl, cream butter and sugar until fluffy. Stir in vanilla. Sift together flour, baking soda, and salt. Stir into the butter mixture. Then stir in the oatmeal, macadamia nuts and coconut. Divide dough into three portions and roll each portion into a log about 2 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap each log in plastic wrap and put into the refrigerator to chill for 2 hours, or wrap and freeze for up  to 2 months. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets or line them with parchment paper. If frozen, let dough logs sit out at room temperature for 5 minutes. Slice each log into 1/4 inch rounds and place about 1 inch apart on prepared baking sheets.  Bake for 12 to 15 minutes until golden brown. A great refrigerator cookie with a tropical twist.  This dough freezes well and only takes a few minutes to thaw and then bake.

In a large bowl, combine 2 cups flour, corn flour, sugar, yeast and salt. In a medium saucepan, heat milk, water and butter until warm. Stir milk mixture and egg into flour mixture. Mix in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth and supple, about 6 to 8 minutes. Knead in the poppy seeds last, reserving 1 tablespoon for topping. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Form into loaf and place in a lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pan. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes.

Remove loaf from pan, brush with melted butter and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon poppy seeds. Place on a wire rack to cool. A delicate and tasty bread with a golden crust sprinkled with poppy seeds.
Preheat the oven to 325 degrees F. Arrange a rack in center of oven. Butter the bottom and sides of a 9 by 2-inch round cake pan and line the bottom with parchment paper. In the top of a double boiler or in a heatproof bowl over barely simmering water, melt the semi-sweet chocolate chips and butter, stirring occasionally until smooth. Cool slightly. Meanwhile, in a large bowl with an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the eggs and salt on medium speed until doubled in volume, about 5 minutes. Gently fold the whipped eggs, a third at a time, into the melted chocolate. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pan. Prepare a water bath for the cake by placing the cake pan in a larger pan, and filling the large pan halfway up the sides of the cake pan with hot, but not boiling water. Bake for about 40 minutes, or until the cake pulls away from the sides of the pan and is set in the center. Remove the pan from the water bath to a cooling rack, and cool the cake completely in the pan. Cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate overnight. To remove the cake from the pan, dip the pan in warm water halfway up the sides and run a thin metal spatula around the inside of the pan. Invert onto a plate to unmold and remove the parchment paper. To prepare the ganache, bring the heavy cream to a simmer in a small saucepan over low heat. Pour the heated cream over the milk chocolate chips. Stir gently until smooth and allow to cool slightly. When the ganache is still warm to the touch, pour over the top of cake and spread with an offset spatula to evenly cover (There will be some ganache leftover.) Chill the cake until the ganache sets, about 30 minutes. To garnish, grate the white chocolate bar on top of cake. Created by Gigi Burton, of Plainsboro, New Jersey, this cake won the grand prize of the Ghirardelli Chocolate 'Is Your Dessert Intense Enough?' contest.
Put water in large pot, and heat on high until boiling. Add sugar and stir until dissolved. Add teabags and let steep until desired strength is acquired.

Pour the coffee mixture into the melted butter, bring to a boil over medium heat, and stir for about 10 seconds; set the butter-coffee mixture aside to cool. Mix the buttermilk, eggs, vanilla extract, and baking soda in a bowl until the baking soda has dissolved. Mix the cooled coffee mixture into the flour mixture, then gently stir in the buttermilk mixture. Pour the batter into the prepared cake pans. Bake in the preheated oven until the cakes are browned, and a toothpick inserted into the center of each cake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Allow the cakes to cool in the pans for about 10 minutes before cooling completely on racks. Mix 3/4 cup of softened butter, confectioners' sugar, 1 tablespoon of instant coffee, and cream in a mixing bowl with an electric mixer on High speed until the frosting is light and creamy; mix in additional cream, 1 teaspoon at a time, if needed to whip frosting to spreadable texture. Frost the cooled cake layers. This coffee-flavored cake has been a hit at BBQs, Easter brunch, and birthday parties. I've had coffee haters, and those who dislike cake, compliment me on this recipe and say they love it.
In a large pot cover the garbanzo beans  with at least 12 cups water. Cook over medium heat for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until tender. Check occasionally, as you might need to add more water. Working in small batches, in a blender, on either the chop or blend setting, process garbanzo beans. Blend until the mixture is a paste.  Add onions, thyme, salt and pepper to the mixture; mix well.

Stir in the remaining butter and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in a large bowl family style, or place about 1 cup of pasta in a large mug or small bowl. Insert a dinner fork in the center of the pasta and twirl the fork around, holding the mug steady. The pasta will wind up tighter and tighter as you turn. Remove the fork and immediately turn the pasta out onto a dinner plate or shallow bowl. Garnish with extra cheese and rosemary sprigs. My mother has been making this dish for as long as I can remember. Lots of rosemary and garlic - what more could you ask for?
Preheat oven to 225 degrees F (110 degrees C). Arrange apples slices on a metal baking sheet. Mix sugar and cinnamon together in a bowl; sprinkle over apple slices. Bake in the preheated until apples are dried and edges curl up, 45 minutes to 1 hour. Transfer apple chips, using a metal spatula, to a wire rack until cooled and crispy. These yummy cinnamon apple chips will disappear almost as quickly as you make them! They're perfect for healthy snacks and easy to take on the road. The secret is baking at a very low temperature for a long time, which dehydrates the apples.
In a slow cooker, combine the chicken breasts and Italian-style dressing. Cover, and cook on Low for 6 to 8 hours. Drain off the juices, and shred the chicken meat.

(For gas grill, preheat grill. Reduce heat to medium. Adjust for indirect grilling. Grill as above.) Top with cheese. Cover; cook 1 to 2 minutes more or until cheese melts. Serve bison patties open face on French bread slices. Figs simmered in pomegranate juice make a gourmet filling for impressive stuffed and grilled bison burgers served on toasted French bread with melted Gruyere cheese.
Fill a margarita glass with crushed ice. Pour tequila, melon liqueur, and triple sec into the glass. Top with sour mix, grenadine, lime juice, and orange juice.  Garnish with the cherry and a wedge of orange. I had something similar at a local Mexican restaurant and recreated it to the best of my knowledge at home.

Prepare an outdoor grill using charcoal briquettes stacked 2 to 3 deep. Season the steaks on both sides with steak seasoning. While the charcoal heats up, fry the bacon in a skillet over medium-high heat until crisp. Remove from the skillet and drain on paper towels. Leave grease in the pan. When the charcoal is covered with gray ashes, put the steaks on the grill. Cook for 12 minutes, turning once, or to your desired degree of doneness. While the steaks are cooking, stir the butter, Worcestershire sauce and mustard into the bacon grease. Cook and stir over medium-high heat until butter has melted. Add the red bell pepper and mushrooms; cook and stir until tender. To serve, place steaks onto plates. Top with bacon, then blue cheese and then the vegetables. Serve immediately. If you are looking for a special steak for your sweetie, look no further. This takes less than thirty minutes from start to finish; less if you choose to broil instead of BBQ. Flavorful and easy, this steak is tough to beat. I serve this with brown-and-serve sourdough bread or rolls. If you're really hungry, crumble some additional bacon and add a baked potato. Add candles and a bottle of full bodied red wine (like a cabernet from the Alexander Valley) for a romantic evening.
Place the potatoes into a large pot; cover with salted water. Bring to a simmer and cook until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain, remove from pan, and reserve.

Bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened to soup consistency. Stir in the frozen vegetables, cooked potatoes, and ham. Simmer chowder until hot, about 10 minutes. My grandmother (Nonnie) used to make this chowder using leftover veggies from the week and a piece of ham on the bone.  It's incredibly creamy and the thyme and pepper make it such a savory dish.  I use a piece of boneless ham steak, but I find that if I don't use ham on the bone, I need to add some salt to get the flavor right.  Enjoy!
In a large bowl, combine the romaine lettuce, iceberg lettuce, artichoke hearts, red onions and pimentos. Toss together. Prepare the dressing by whisking together the olive oil, red wine vinegar, salt, pepper and cheese. Refrigerate until chilled and pour over salad to coat. Toss and serve.

In a large bowl, cream together the 1/2 cup butter, shortening, light brown sugar and white sugar until smooth. Beat in the eggs one at a time then stir in the vanilla. Combine the 1 tablespoon cinnamon, flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Cover and refrigerate dough for at least 1 hour. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). In a small microwave safe dish, heat the 1/2 cup brown sugar, 1/4 cup of butter and 2 teaspoons cinnamon in the microwave. Stir frequently until butter is melted and the mixture is well blended. On a lightly floured surface, roll out each half of the dough to a 12x6 inch rectangle. Spread 1/3 of the cinnamon mixture over each rectangle. Roll each one lengthwise into a log. Cut into 1 inch segments. Use remaining filling to place a small dollop of the mixture onto the cookie sheet where each cookie will be placed, About every 3 inches. Place 1 cookie onto each dollop with the cut side down. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven. Flip cookie sheet over onto a tray to remove cookies while they are still very hot. If the cookies are stuck, heat the pan in the oven again for a few minutes to soften the cinnamon dollops. These cookies are a big hit with my family and friends. They are so delicious!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Slide orange slices under chicken skin (skin will pull up easily). Place chicken in a 9x13 inch baking dish skin-side-up. Then place potatoes, carrots, onions and celery around the chicken and pour broth over all. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Bake for 1 hour at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).

A whole chicken flavored with fresh orange slices, then baked with potatoes, carrots, onions, and celery.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Toss the sweet potato chunks, olive oil, salt, and black pepper in a large bowl, and spread the sweet potatoes out onto a large rimmed baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until browned and tender, about 40 minutes; stir after the first 20 minutes. Cook the bacon until crisp and brown in a large skillet over medium heat, about 10 minutes; transfer bacon to a bowl, but leave the grease in the skillet. Cook the onions in the bacon grease until browned, about 10 minutes, stirring frequently. Reduce heat to low, and cook the onions until very soft, brown, and sweet, another 10 to 15 minutes. Stir often. Mix the onions with the bacon in the bowl, and set aside. Pour the maple syrup into the hot skillet with the thyme, and bring to a rolling boil. Boil the syrup until reduced by half, 3 to 4 minutes. Place the roasted sweet potatoes and onion-bacon mixture into the skillet, and stir to coat the vegetables with maple glaze. Transfer to a serving dish. I made this for Thanksgiving dinner and my family went crazy over it.  It is simple, looks great on the table and has already been requested for Christmas dinner! This recipe can be adjusted as you like by adding more or less bacon and onions.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease cookie sheets. In a Dutch oven or large saucepan over medium heat,  heat sorghum, stirring constantly. Stir in baking soda and remove from heat. Stir in the sugar and eggs; mix well. Combine the salt, cinnamon, allspice, cloves and nutmeg; mix into the  sorghum mixture. Gradually stir in the flour until dough is stiff enough to roll out. The amount of flour may be adjusted. On a lightly floured surface, roll the dough out to 1/4 inch thickness. Cut into desired shapes using cookie cutters. I like to cut them into squares with a pizza cutter. Place cookies 1 inch apart onto the prepared cookie sheets. Bake for 10 to 12 minutes in the preheated oven, until cookies are firm but not crisp. Remove from baking sheets immediately or they will stick. Cool on wire racks. When cool, place into an airtight container with the 1/2 apple for about a week, or until they are soft enough to bend. Frost with confectioners' sugar frosting if you like. This is a recipe my mom made for us as kids. It a molasses cookies that is hard until left in a sealed container with a half of apple for a week. It's great frosted with confectioners' sugar frosting.
Soak beans overnight in cold water. Simmer the beans in the same water until tender, approximately 1 to 2 hours. Drain and reserve the liquid. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Arrange the beans in a 2 quart bean pot or casserole dish by placing a portion of the beans in the bottom of dish, and layering them with bacon and onion. In a saucepan, combine molasses, salt, pepper, dry mustard, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce and brown sugar. Bring the mixture to a boil and pour over beans. Pour in just enough of the reserved bean water to cover the beans. Cover the dish with a lid or aluminum foil. Bake for 3 to 4 hours in the preheated oven, until beans are tender. Remove the lid about halfway through cooking, and add more liquid if necessary to prevent the beans from getting too dry. A wonderful old-fashioned baked bean flavor. This recipe has served by family for 29 years and originally came from my mother-in-law.  It tastes great served with fresh cornbread or biscuits and honey. Although you need to allow time for soaking and simmering the beans, this recipe is still quite easy.

Here you can find the mill that was the first to make the Zaanse Mosterd (Zaanse mustard). This mustard is coarse and have whole yellow and brown mustard seeds. This is the only kind of mustard you can use for this recipe! When the soup is warm, serve with freshly baked and buttered bread. Eet smakelijk! Good appetite!

Sift together the flour, baking powder and salt; stir into the egg yolk mixture a little at a time. Turn the dough out onto a heavily floured surface and knead vigorously for about 1/2 hour. Allow the dough to absorb as much of the flour as it can so it is no longer sticky. Separate dough into 4 or 5 portions and roll out very thin. The dough should be almost as thin as paper, and slightly see-through. Cut dough into strips about 1 1/2 inches wide and 4 inches long. Make a 1 1/2 inch slit in the strip closer to one end. Pull the long end of the strip through the slit. Heat the oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the cookies quickly, turning once. They should be golden but not brown.

Cook and stir onion in the oil and drippings retained in the skillet until tender, about 3 minutes; add apple slices and continue cooking until the apple slices are tender, about 2 minutes. Pour apple juice over the onion and apple mixture; add brown sugar and remaining flour mixture and stir to dissolve. Return pork chops to the skillet. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to low, and cook at a simmer until the pork is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). This is dish is one of the most loved in my home and is asked for weekly. I hope others will enjoy as well.
Melt butter in a heavy saucepan over medium heat; add brown sugar, cream, and corn syrup. Bring to a boil; cook and stir until sugar dissolves, about 1 minute.

Deeply score into 8 wedges. Prick surface using tines of fork. Repeat steps with remaining disc of dough and another pie plate. Bake 35 minutes, or until golden brown. Remove to wire rack. Cool completely and cut into wedges. This is an apple pie flavored shortbread cookie. It is wonderful for a holiday brunch, as well as a  simple dessert for an intimate holiday dinner. They are also simple to make.
In a medium-size mixing bowl, combine tomatoes, onion, cilantro, garlic, lime juice, tomatillo, and salt to taste. Mix well. Add 1/2 of the jalapeno pepper, and taste. If you desire your salsa with more of a kick, add the remaining 1/2 jalapeno. If you are satisfied with the salsa's heat, do not add the remaining jalapeno pepper. Cover the salsa, and chill until ready to serve. This is a recipe I just throw together, but it is very popular. Serve with tortilla chips.
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over high heat. Cook and stir the onion in the hot oil until it begins to soften, about 2 minutes. Stir the garlic into the onion and cook another 2 minutes.

Firmly hold the lid in place and carefully start the blender, using a few quick pulses to get the soup moving before leaving it on to puree. Puree in batches until smooth; pour into your serving dish. Alternately, you can use a stick blender and puree the soup in cooking pot. This soup is divine and much like you will get at any authentic Turkish restaurant. It has dynamic flavors and a lovely mild heat. I make a big batch and eat it for lunch with crusty bread and salad the entire week. Optional: Serve with additional mint and lemon wedges.
Place meat in a large resealable plastic bag. In a medium bowl, mix together honey, Dijon mustard, chili powder, and salt. Pour marinade over tenderloins, seal, and refrigerate for at least 4 hours. Prepare the grill for indirect heat. Lightly oil grill grate. Remove meat from marinade, and discard liquid. Grill for 15 to 25 minutes, or until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center reads 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). This is a quick, easy and very flavorful recipe. I've made it many times. Plan ahead because the pork needs to marinate.
Stir together the water, sugar, and yeast until dissolved, allow to stand for 5 minutes. Stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/4 cup rosemary, flour, and salt until a dough forms.

Once the drumsticks have cooked, remove them to a serving platter and keep warm. Dissolve the cornstarch in 2 teaspoons of water, and stir into the simmering sauce. Add the peach, and cook until the sauce thickens and returns to a simmer. Pour sauce over the drumsticks to serve. My neighbor used to have a restaurant in Indonesia.

Stir in milk and 1 tablespoon vanilla. Cook and stir until thickened, 5 minutes. Invert cake onto a plastic cake carrier or container; poke holes over entire cake using a knife. Pour hot icing over entire cake. Pour any remaining icing into the center of the cake. The icing will absorb into the cake overnight. I store my cake in a plastic cake carrier turned upside down. The icing will run off, therefore a regular cake plate will not work unless you have one with high sides. This cake is much better the day after. It is so very moist. It is even better if you put your slice in the microwave for 10 seconds to just have it warm. My family would disown me if I did not have this cake for holiday get-togethers. Nothing better with a cup of coffee.

Remove the carcass, sachet, ginger, and onion from the soup. Strain the soup to remove any meat that may have fallen off the bones, if necessary. Season with fish sauce and salt. Divide the rice noodles and turkey meat evenly into 4 large bowls. Scatter the basil, cilantro, and sliced onion on top. Ladle the soup on top. Serve with a wedge of lime and hot sauce. With the addition of fragrant spices and rice noodles, leftover turkey noodle soup gets a Vietnamese makeover.
Sprinkle the gelatin over the cold water and set aside to soften for 10 minutes. In a saucepan over medium-high heat, bring the milk just to the boiling point. Whisk the egg yolks with the sugar and salt. In a steady stream, pour the hot milk into the egg yolks, whisking constantly. Add the softened gelatin to the hot custard and stir until fully dissolved. Stir in the vanilla extract. Let the mixture cool to room temperature. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Toast the coconut on a baking sheet until golden, about 4 minutes, stirring once or twice. (You may use a toaster oven for this step). Transfer to a plate to cool, reserving about 1 tablespoon toasted coconut for garnishing. Whip the egg whites until medium-stiff peaks form; gently fold the egg whites into the cooled custard mixture. Whip the cream until medium-stiff peaks form. Fold the cream into the custard mixture, along with the toasted coconut. Pour the Bavarian cream into serving glasses and chill for at least three hours before serving. Garnish with the reserved toasted coconut. A family recipe usually saved for special occasions, this looks beautiful served in wine or martini glasses. It has a rich taste with a light texture. I recommend starting early on this, as the dessert needs time to set in the refrigerator. Great for when the oven is occupied with other dishes!
Butter one side of each slice of bread, and place 4 of the slices butter-side down on a griddle over medium heat. On each piece of bread, place one slice of cheese, 1 slice of tomato, and a few slices of serrano pepper. Sprinkle dried basil and salt and pepper to taste. Top each sandwich with a slice of buttered bread, butter-side up. Grill sandwiches until golden brown, about 2 to 3 minutes each side. Classic grilled cheese sandwiches with a kick.  Delicious!  These are great with a bowl of tomato soup with a little basil added.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray 2 12-cup muffin pans with cooking spray. Place the chopped bacon and onion in a skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, stirring occasionally, until the onions are translucent and the bacon is half cooked, about 5 minutes. Drain excess fat. Place bacon mixture into a large bowl, and mix in the turkey, veal, bread crumbs, milk, eggs, steak sauce, brown sugar, garlic powder, basil, ground mustard, cumin, black pepper, sea salt, and sage until thoroughly combined. Fill  the sprayed muffin cups with meatloaf mixture, and make a hole in the center of each muffin with your little finger for even cooking. Bake in the preheated oven until the juices run clear and the internal temperature is at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C) when measured with a meat thermometer, about 30 minutes. Brush each muffin with barbecue sauce, return to the oven, and bake 5 additional minutes. Whisk brown gravy mix and water in a saucepan, and place over medium heat. Continue whisking until the gravy comes to a boil. Reduce heat and allow to simmer until thickened, about 1 minute. To serve, place muffins in a deep serving dish, and pour the brown gravy over them. These little guys are so savory and scrumptious! Ground turkey and veal, minced onions, chopped bacon, garlic powder, smokey cumin....yummy! I like to serve these with rice and roasted veggies. Both men and kids will love these individual size meat loaves.
Mix together the tomato soup, vegetable juice cocktail, Worcestershire sauce, onion flakes, dried parsley, horseradish, Dijon mustard, garlic powder, black pepper, tapioca, and water in a slow cooker. Set the cooker on Low, and cook until thickened, 3 to 4 hours. I think this is a tangy, tasty, easy go-to sauce when I need it to be quick and dumped into the slow cooker.  I used a recipe similar to this but it only had three of the ingredients and I added more items to make it flavorful and to our liking...hope you do too!  We think it goes well with our favorite meatball recipe or as a sauce for our favorite meatloaf.
In a medium bowl, mix together the coconut, vanilla wafer crumbs, pecans, orange juice concentrate, vanilla and bourbon. Cover and refrigerate for several hours or overnight. Roll the dough into 1 inch balls, and roll in confectioners' sugar. If not serving right away, give them a fresh roll in the sugar just before serving. I can't remember where I got this recipe but it was one we used to make at Christmas with my family growing up. This recipe has been in the family approximately 30 years.
To brine shrimp, combine water, salt, sugar, and Kikkoman Soy Sauce in a large bowl, stirring to dissolve salt and sugar. Submerge 2 pounds of peeled and deveined shrimp in the brine.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix the chili and enchilada sauce together in a small saucepan over medium-low heat, stirring occasionally as it simmers. Heat the vegetable oil and chili powder together in a small skillet over medium heat. Gently lay a tortilla in the hot oil and cook until the tortilla starts to puff. Remove with a spatula and place on a plate. Immediately sprinkle about 1/4 cup Cheddar cheese and 1 tablespoon chopped onion down the center of the tortilla; roll the tortilla tightly around the mixture and place, seam-side down, into the bottom of a 9x13-inch baking dish. Repeat this process until all the tortillas are used. Sprinkle about 2/3 of the remaining Cheddar cheese over the rolled enchiladas. Pour the warm chili mixture evenly over the enchiladas. Scatter the remaining Cheddar cheese over the layer of the chili mixture. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. These are authentic Tex-Mex enchiladas as taught to me by a lady originally from Chihuahua, Mexico who then added a bit of Texas. They are super easy to put together and taste incredible! Watch out though, because there is nothing low-fat about them! I like to assemble these enchiladas in the morning or night before, come home and pop them in the oven.  When cold, add 10 more minutes to the baking time. Leave out the onions for picky eaters.  
In a large bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt.  Cut in butter or margarine until crumbly.  Make a well in the center.  Beat egg until light and frothy, and mix in milk; pour all at once into well.  Stir lightly to form a soft dough.  Add more milk if needed.

Arrange well apart on a greased baking sheet.  Make a deep hollow in the center of each biscuit.  Drop a small spoonful of jam into each hollow. Bake in a preheated 450 degrees F (230 degrees C) oven for 12 to 15 minutes.  Serve hot. These little buns will disappear in a flash.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Mix honey, Dijon mustard, and black pepper together in a bowl until texture of a paste. Heat a cast iron skillet over medium-high heat. Cook pork loin in the hot skillet until browned on all sides, about 5 minutes. Transfer pork loin to a baking dish. Spread honey paste over entire pork loin. Spread pineapple chunks around pork loin and sprinkle salt over pork loin. Place a cooking thermometer into the pork loin and cover dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 5 minutes. Decrease oven temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Continue cooking until pork is cooked through, 30 to 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Transfer pork loin to a work surface and let rest, 3 to 5 minutes. Blend pineapple chunks and drippings in a blender until sauce is smooth; serve alongside pork loin. This is a quick, easy, and healthy way to prepare pork loin with no added fat. The pork turns out very moist and the sauce is very flavorful. Serve with your favorite vegetable side dish or salad for a complete meal. Serve over rice with a generous helping of the sauce. Yum!
Heat soup in a saucepan over medium heat until hot, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir butter, flour, garlic salt, onion powder, salt, and black pepper into soup; add spinach, stir, and cook until heated through, about 5 minutes. I had only one package of spinach and didn't have onion so I added a bit more garlic and onion powder, forgot the flour, and used just one tablespoon butter. This was easy, quick (defrosted spinach in microwave), and done when the steaks came off the grill. Perfect quick and fancy side dish for a steakhouse dinner at diner prices. I would definitely serve this again and add the onion and cheese or breadcrumbs. Tomorrow, soup for one.
Heat oil to 365 degrees in a deep fryer or heavy saucepan. In a medium bowl, beat the egg, 1/4 cup sugar and 1 teaspoon oil until light. combine the flour, baking powder and salt, stir in alternately with the milk until well blended. Drop by teaspoonfuls into the hot oil and fry on both sides until golden. Drain on paper towels and roll in 1/2 cup white sugar while still warm. Fried dumplings rolled in sugar. These are a little bit like doughnuts.
Season ribs with salt and pepper. Place in bottom of 5-quart slow cooker. Combine remaining ingredients in food processor and process until smooth. Cover ribs with sauce. Cook on low 8 to 10 hours, or on high 4 to 5 hours. Serve warm. Fall-off-the-bone tender, these baby back ribs cook long and slow in a tangy, spicy sauce.
Preheat oven to 320 degrees F (160 degrees C). Grease a small loaf pan. Beat sugar and egg whites together in a bowl using an electric mixer until stiff peaks form. Add egg yolk and mix well.

Preheat an oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Butter an 8x8-inch baking dish and sprinkle 1 tablespoon cornmeal over the bottom of the dish. Sift the all-purpose flour, semolina flour, 1/4 cup cornmeal, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Whisk the eggs, buttermilk, and vegetable oil together in a separate large bowl. Mix the flour mixture into the egg mixture until just combined; don't overmix. The batter should be pourable; add more buttermilk as needed to get the right consistency. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 20 minutes. This is a recipe from my hometown of Sarajevo, and it is similar to a southern cornbread. What makes it unique is the addition of semolina flour (or Cream of Wheat®). If you don't have semolina flour, you can just replace it with additional corn meal. This recipes also makes excellent muffins.
Melt the chocolate with the cream in a double boiler over medium-low heat, stirring constantly until the mixture is smooth; remove from heat and set aside to cool. Whisk the eggs and vanilla extract together in a large bowl until combined; stir the condensed milk into the mixture. Slowly pour the whiskey into the egg mixture while stirring until completely incorporated. Add the chocolate mixture and the espresso; beat with the whisk until the mixture is uniform in color. Pour into a bottle, cap, and chill in refrigerator at least 4 hours before enjoying. Store in refrigerator. This creamy liqueur has been a favorite of mine for many years and beats any of the store-bought varieties hands down!
In a medium bowl, cream together the cream cheese and butter until creamy. Mix in the vanilla, then gradually stir in the confectioners' sugar. Store in the refrigerator after use. This is a wonderfully creamy frosting that goes well with pumpkin bread, carrot cake, chocolate cake, on cookies, or between cookies. If you want chocolate frosting, add 1/4 to 1/2 cup cocoa, according to how rich you want it.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Cut and set aside 25 pieces of plastic wrap about 5 inches square. For cookies, beat 1/2 cup of vegetable shortening, 2 cups of milk, 2 cups of sugar, the eggs, and 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract together in a large mixing bowl until smooth and creamy. In a separate bowl, whisk the 4 cups of flour with both amounts of unsweetened cocoa, baking soda, and salt until thoroughly combined. Beat the flour mixture into the wet ingredients just until smooth. Scoop up the batter by teaspoons, and drop onto ungreased baking sheets in small round dollops about 2 inches apart. Recipe should make about 50 cookies. The cookies will rise and expand a lot. Bake in the preheated oven until the cookies are set in the middle, 8 to 10 minutes. Allow to cool on baking sheets for several minutes before removing to finish cooling on racks. To make the filling, place 1 cup milk in a microwave-safe measuring cup, and cook in microwave until hot but not simmering, 1 to 2 minutes. Pour the heated milk into a large mixing bowl. Add the cup of room temperature butter, 1 cup of vegetable shortening, 2 cups of sugar, 2 tablespoons of flour, 2 teaspoons of vanilla extract, and the marshmallow creme. Beat the mixture on high speed until the frosting is fluffy, 5 to 10 minutes. At first the frosting will appear lumpy, but keep beating. To fill the cookies, choose 2 cookies that are about the same size, and spread about 1 1/2 tablespoon of the frosting onto the flat bottom of a cookie. Top with the other cookie, flat side down, and wrap the filled cookie in a sheet of plastic wrap. Place the filled cookie into the freezer. Repeat with remaining cookies and frosting, wrapping each whoopie pie in plastic wrap and freezing. To serve, remove whoopie pies from the freezer and allow to thaw until very cold but not frozen, 10 to 15 minutes. Whoopie Pies are one of those comfort foods that make you want more than one. They just don't get any better. Though Whoopie Pies can be delicious any old way...the preferred way to have them is about 5-10 minutes out of the freezer. Tall glass of milk and one of these Whoopies...you will not have a care in the world!  The frosting is phenomenal, but make sure you remember that when making it, it will look like a real mess until you've beaten it on high for at least five minutes.  Sometime after that it will become like nothing you've seen or eaten. This makes a big batch and is easily halved.

Combine 1 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk, sour cream, salt, and black pepper in the pot with potatoes. Mash with a potato masher until creamy. Spread potato mixture into prepared baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 25 minutes; sprinkle with bacon, green onions, and remaining 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese. Return to oven and continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. Great and easy potato casserole packed with bacon, Cheddar, and green onions.
Place all of the ingredients except for the mixed fruit into the pan of your bread machine in order directed by manufacturer. Select Sweet or Basic/White bread cycle, and use the Medium or Light crust color. Do not use the delay cycles. Add the fruit 5 to 10 minutes before the last kneading cycle ends, or when the raisin or nut signal starts. This is an Italian Christmas bread. This recipe is only suitable for the bread machine. I have tried it many times successfully, you will love it.
Blend the egg white, salt, sugar, mustard powder, and lemon juice in a blender until combined; slowly stream the vegetable oil into the mixture while blending, about 1/4 cup at a time, until thick.

Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the water has cooked down a bit, about 5 minutes. Stir in the milk, and continue boiling for another 5 minutes.  Add the Cheddar, Parmesan, pepper, and mustard; stir until the cheese melts and the sauce is thick and creamy. The starch from the pasta thickens the sauce as the pasta cooks. This recipe uses less milk and no thickener what-so-ever! Very cheesy, too! You can either serve it from the pot, or top with buttered crumbs and put in 350 oven to brown for half an hour, but we like ours fine without. 
In a pot, bring the wild rice and water to a boil. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes. In a separate pot, melt the butter over medium heat, and saute the onion until tender.

Continue to cook and stir about 5 minutes, until heated through. Thoroughly blend the half and half into the soup just before serving. This is an extremely easy recipe, and fabulous tasting, too. I have been making it for over 6 years and we never tire of it. It's rich, and warms you up on a cold winter day.
Combine the cranberries, raisins, white sugar, brown sugar, cinnamon, ginger, cloves and water in a saucepan. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat until berries start to pop, about 5 minutes. Add the onion, apple, and celery; continue to cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to thicken, 5 to 10 more minutes. Transfer to a container and cool slightly. Refrigerate overnight to allow the flavors to blossom. This piquant chutney is not as sweet as traditional cranberry sauce. The bite of the fresh ginger will become more pronounced as the chutney rests. If you have any left after Thanksgiving, try it in turkey sandwiches with a smear of cream cheese. Oh. My. God.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add linguine pasta, and cook for 8 to 10 minutes, or until al dente; drain. Melt butter in a saute pan over medium heat.

Elegant little tea cookies with an almond pressed into the top. I like to cut the whole almonds in half to put on top of the cookies.
In a large, heavy skillet, heat oil to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Fry the drumettes until lightly browned and no longer pink on the inside. Remove from heat and drain excess oil. In a large saucepan, bring the tomato soup and water to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer. Mix in the drumettes, green bell peppers and Vidalia onion. Simmer approximately 15 minutes. A lovely, inexpensive meal that uses chicken drumettes, tomato soup, green peppers and sweet Vidalia onions. Serve it over white rice.
Place tofu in a resealable plastic bag; freeze until completely solid, at least 24 hours. Defrost tofu in the refrigerator or a bowl of cold water. Slice tofu into 1/4- to 1/2-inch-thick pieces. Gently squeeze each slice to release water. Whisk 2 to 4 tablespoons artichoke heart marinade and about 1 teaspoon caper brine together in a bowl; pour enough over each tofu piece so that it absorbs the marinade. Place bread crumbs in a bowl.

Pour cheese sauce over macaroni; toss to coat. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Mix Parmesan cheese and panko crumbs together in a bowl; sprinkle over macaroni. Bake until Parmesan cheese is melted, 3 to 5 minutes. Cauliflower and nutritional yeast add protein and vitamins while blending the cauliflower, Greek yogurt, low-fat sharp Cheddar, and chicken stock create a creamy texture. The sharp Cheddar plus spices maintain a nice cheesy taste. It's better than you might think.
Place zucchini slices in a colander for 10 minutes, allowing juices to release; pat dry. Combine zucchini, onion, and parsley together in a bowl.

I used a bunch of different fruit, but kiwi is the main fruit here and the smoothie has a nice slightly tart, tangy, and sweet taste. I use soy milk, but non-fat milk would taste the same.

Serve with a citrus and fennel salad and some crusty bread for a full meal.   I like to leave the garlic cloves whole as above and spread the cloves on the bread during meal. If you don't, then reduce garlic but chop and don't add until after liquid has been added or it may scorch.

Cook lentils, kidney beans, 5 cups water, and salt in a pot over medium heat until tender, stirring occasionally, about 1 hour. Remove from heat and set aside. Keep the lentils, kidney beans, and any excess cooking water in the pot. Heat vegetable oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Cook cumin seeds in the hot oil until they begin to pop, 1 to 2 minutes. Add cardamom pods, cinnamon stick, bay leaves, and cloves; cook until bay leaves turn brown, about 1 minute. Reduce heat to medium-low; add ginger paste, garlic paste, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. Stir to coat. Stir tomato puree into spice mixture; cook over medium heat until slightly reduced, about 5 minutes. Add chili powder, coriander, and butter; cook and stir until butter is melted. Stir lentils, kidney beans and any leftover cooking water into tomato mixture; bring to a boil, reduce heat to low. Stir fenugreek into lentil mixture. Cover saucepan and simmer until heated through, stirring occasionally, about 45 minutes. Add cream and cook until heated through, 2 to 4 minutes. Ever go to an Indian restaurant and wonder how they make those lentils? I hated lentils before I discovered Indian food. Then I scoured the internet to figure out how they achieved them, and through mixing and matching recipes and methods on videos, I've arrived at this recipe, which I think is pretty close. This version is very rich, but you can leave out the cream to make it lighter. Kasuri methi (fenugreek leaves) is almost impossible to find in the U.S., even in NYC, but it gives this dish something very special.
Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Mix the spinach, feta cheese, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, garlic, and salt in a bowl. Arrange one sheet of phyllo dough on a clean work surface and brush with melted butter. Cover the remaining phyllo dough with a damp towel. Place a second sheet of phyllo on top and brush with butter, then place a third sheet on top. Cut the buttered phyllo lengthwise into four strips. Place about 1 tablespoon of the spinach mixture on the bottom of each strip. Take the bottom right corner and fold the dough over the filling to make a triangle. Fold the bottom left corner up to make another triangle. Continue folding until all the dough is folded. Arrange the stuffed triangles, seam-side down, on the prepared baking sheet. Lightly brush the triangle with butter. Repeat with the remaining phyllo dough and spinach filling. Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 20 minutes. Cool slightly before serving. Phyllo dough and frozen spinach makes this Greek-inspired dish a breeze.
In a medium bowl, thoroughly blend cream cheese, cottage cheese, sour cream and butter. Gradually fold in sugar, lemon extract, vanilla extract, almonds and currants. Transfer the mixture to a shallow medium dish. Cover with a cloth, and chill in the refrigerator 8 hours, or overnight. Pashka is a cheese cake-like dessert or breakfast food that is usually eaten with thick-crusted breads, but I like it plain, too. Though no cooking is needed, it does chill over night. My Bestemor has made this for me since I was a child and I have always loved it!
In a small bowl, mix vegetable oil, soy sauce, vinegar, ketchup, and crushed garlic. Place flank steak in a large resealable plastic bag. Pour the marinade over steak. Seal, and marinate in the refrigerator at least 3 hours. Preheat grill for high heat. Oil the grill grate. Place steaks on the grill, and discard marinade. Cook for 5 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. A soy sauce and garlic mixture makes for one tasty flank steak marinade.
Place the wine and saffron in a cup or small bowl. Stir briefly, then let it sit. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion; cook and stir until transparent, about 3 minutes. Mix in the rice, and continue cooking and stirring until the rice has absorbed most of the butter. Slowly stir the white wine and saffron into the rice, stirring  continuously until the wine is absorbed and rice is creamy. Season with thyme, then pour in 1 cup of chicken broth at a time, cooking and stirring constantly until each cup of broth is absorbed before adding the next. Stop adding broth when the rice is tender. If you run out of broth, you may use water. Remove from the heat, stir in the Parmesan cheese and allow to cool until you can touch it without burning your hands. Lightly grease a large cookie sheet with olive oil. Pour the risotto out onto the sheet and spread evenly. Place in the refrigerator for about 1 hour or until chilled. When the rice is cool, roll small portions into balls about the size of golf balls. Tuck a cube of fontina cheese into the center of each one. Roll each ball in bread crumbs to coat. Heat the olive oil in a heavy saucepan or deep fryer to 375 degrees F 190 degrees C). The oil should be about 3 inches deep. When the oil is hot, fry the arancini until they reach a golden orangish brown, about 3 minutes. Arancini literally means 'little oranges'. Cool for 5 minutes, then serve with any marinara sauce. Risotto balls are stuffed with cheese, breaded and fried. The ooey gooey centers filled with delicious fontina cheese and fresh thyme add classic flavor to this Italian dish. A favorite of my family.
In a medium bowl, combine the Worcestershire, lime juice, soy sauce, and chile powder.  Add the shrimp and marinate 15 minutes. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook the zucchini, onion, and corn for 10 minutes or until the vegetables are tender.  Cover to keep warm and set aside. In a separate skillet heat olive oil over medium heat.  Add the shrimp and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, until the shrimp are pink.  Combine the shrimp and the vegetables.  Place shrimp and vegetable mixture in tortillas; sprinkle with the Monterey Jack cheese and cilantro. Marinated shrimp, vegetables, and cheese enclosed in flour tortillas.  I love making these fajitas...and my friends love it when I make them.
In a large pot, bring the water to a boil.  Add the salt and olive oil. Chop up the chicken, and add it with the onion and garlic to the pot. Break the spaghetti into small pieces, no longer than half the size of your pinkie; add to the pot.  Stir. Let simmer over medium heat for 30 to 45 minutes. This soup tastes great and is easy to do! Serve with a loaf of bread.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the potatoes and let cook until tender. While the potatoes cook, in a large bowl, whisk together the vinegar, sugar, mustard, salt and pepper.  Drain the potatoes, stir them into the vinegar mixture and let them marinate for 30 minutes to absorb the flavors. In a small bowl, whisk the mayonnaise, sour cream and heavy cream.  Fold this creamy mixture into the potato mixture along with the onions and hard-cooked eggs.  Cover and chill before serving if you wish.  (This salad keeps for up to 3 days in the refrigerator.) Our country's birthday on the Fourth of July is traditionally celebrated with parades, American flags waving in the breeze, fireworks exploding in summery skies, and picnics under cool shade trees.  Of course, the picnic has almost always included potato salad, often this creamy old-time version.
Melt the chips in a saucepan on low heat.  Stir in the nuts and the noodles. Then drop by teaspoonfuls onto waxed paper-lined cookie sheet.   Cool and then store covered in the refrigerator. These cookies are absolutely delicious.
Stir 1 teaspoon salt, 1/4 teaspoon black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a small bowl; rub evenly into the chicken breasts. Heat the olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook the chicken in the heated oil until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 5 to 7 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Stir the onion, lime juice, and avocado together in a bowl; season with salt and pepper. Spoon over the chicken breasts to serve. I have impressed many friends with this fresh-tasting and easy chicken dish. Enjoy!
Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Bring water to a boil. Add cauliflower, cover, and steam until tender, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, heat olive oil in a small skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until softened, about 2 minutes. Remove from heat. Transfer half the cauliflower to a food processor; cover and blend on high. Add remaining cauliflower florets, one at a time, until vegetables are creamy. Blend in garlic, Parmesan cheese, cream cheese, salt, and black pepper. This recipe is so easy and healthy. I love mashed potatoes, and when I started the South Beach Diet® and couldn't have them, I had to find an alternative. This is an awesome alternative, and people who hate vegetables love it. I do recommend using a large food processor for this recipe.
Place the chicken, onion, celery, apple, chicken broth, milk, curry powder, and paprika into a slow cooker; stir until mixed. Cover, and cook on Low for 4 to 5 hours. Stir in the quinoa during the final 35 minutes of cooking. Serve when quinoa is tender. Chicken, quinoa, and apples, combine in this tasty, easy curry!
Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Cook chicken in boiling water, skimming any fat, until partially cooked through, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir tomato puree, whole onion, bay leaves, cardamom pods, mistika, salt, and pepper into the pot. Cook until chicken is cooked through and tender, about 50 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). This is the basic Egyptian soup. A traditional Egyptian meal consists of lamb, beef, or chicken, soup, rice, and a vegetable. This is the base soup for almost every Egyptian recipe. A Ramadan winner.
Heat olive oil in a large pot over medium heat; cook and stir chicken until no longer pink, 5 to 10 minutes. Add onion and garlic; cook and stir until onion is slightly tender, about 4 minutes. Pour chicken broth and water over chicken mixture; add potatoes, carrots, peas, salt, and pepper. Bring liquid to a boil. Place mushrooms in a food processor and pulse until minced. Add mushrooms and farro to broth mixture. Cover pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer until farro is tender, about 30 minutes. Season soup with thyme. I hate mushrooms, but this recipe actually makes them edible. Being diabetic, I was trying to develop recipes that make the foods I hate edible and came up with this one. Both my wife (who loves mushrooms) and I like this stew.
Cut each zucchini in half and use a thin, sharp knife to hollow out each section, removing the seeds and leaving a round 1/2 inch shell. Combine tomatoes with juice, tomato paste, 3/4 cup water, and cinnamon in a large, oven-safe Dutch oven. Bring to a simmer over medium heat; cook until thick, about 20 minutes. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a small skillet. Stir in onion; cook until tender, about 5 minutes. Combine cooked onion, lamb, rice, 2 tablespoons olive oil, 1/2 cup water, dried mint, and salt in a large bowl. Mix well. Lightly stuff lamb mixture into hollowed out zucchini sections. Place stuffed zucchini in simmering tomato sauce. Cover pot and place in preheated oven. Cook until the rice is soft, about 1 hour. If sauce is very thin, simmer on the stove top until desired consistency. To serve, slice into 1 inch rounds and top with tomato sauce. This recipe is a great way to use up that giant zucchini lurking in your garden. Early-season squash are best, as the skin is tender and the flesh is delicate. Older zucchini still taste great, you just may not be able to eat the skin.
Chop cranberries in a blender or food processor. Stir cranberries, orange juice, raisins, and sugar together in a saucepan; bring to a simmer and cook until cranberries soften, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool. Fold apples into cranberry mixture. This cranberry relish is vastly superior to anything in a can and is both quick and easy.
Heat oil in a saucepan over medium-high heat; saute onion in hot oil until slightly softened, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir in quinoa and taco seasoning; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour water into quinoa mixture. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, cover the saucepan with a lid, and simmer for 15 minutes. Stir beans and tomatoes into quinoa mixture, cover the saucepan again with the lid, and simmer until quinoa is tender and water is absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Stir Cheddar cheese into quinoa, spoon into bowls, and top each with a dollop of sour cream. I was craving Mexican, but didn't have a whole lot in the house, rather than go shopping I threw this together and liked it so much I figured I should share the recipe. Next time I'm going to try adding corn with the tomatoes and kidney beans, perhaps a Mexican cheese blend, and Greek yogurt rather than sour cream. Also, I used the Allrecipes top-rated recipe for taco seasoning rather than a packet from the store.
Preheat oven to 450 degrees F (230 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. On a lightly floured surface, roll puff pastry to 13x13 inches square. With a sharp knife, trim to 12x12 inches. Cut into 3 equal strips, 4x12 inches. Poke each strip several times with a fork. Arrange on prepared baking sheet. Sprinkle with hazelnuts. Bake in preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes, or until puffed and golden. Allow to cool. If not equal in size, trim with a serrated knife, using a gentle sawing motion. Melt chocolate in a bowl over barely simmering water, stirring constantly, until smooth. Cool to room temperature. In a large bowl, beat together cream cheese, brown sugar and coffee until smooth. Blend in melted chocolate. Fold in ground hazelnuts and almonds. In a large bowl, whip cream until peaks form. Fold 1/3 of the whipped cream into the cheese mixture, then quickly fold in remaining whipped cream until no streaks remain. Spread 1/3 of filling on a strip of puff pastry. Repeat layers. Refrigerate for 3 hours, or until set. With a serrated knife, cut into 10 slices using a gentle sawing motion. It's similar to chocolate lasagna, but with puff pastry. If you have the time, it's quite the masterpiece. Don't worry, puff pastry isn't that hard to work with - just be gentle with it.
Set the oven to broil at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). In a small saucepan, combine the olive oil, butter and garlic. Set over medium heat, and cook until butter has melted and the mixture starts to bubble. Season with salt and pepper. Remove from the heat. Dip each slice of bread into the garlic mixture, turning to coat each side. Place Parmesan cheese on a plate. Press one side of each piece of bread into the cheese, and place cheese side up on a baking sheet. Broil on the middle rack of the preheated oven for about 8 minutes, or until golden brown. This is a crispy, flavorful way to serve a baguette that is so pretty it is perfect for entertaining!
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Line 24 muffin cups with paper muffin liners. Divide sugar cookie dough into each muffin cup. Bake in the preheated oven until the cookie dough softens and spreads across the bottom of each muffin cup, 8 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and set aside. Beat the cream cheese, sour cream, sugar, flour, and milk with an electric mixer in a large bowl until smooth. Beat the first egg into the cream cheese mixture until completely blended, then beat in the last egg.  Mix in the instant pudding mix until just incorporated. Spoon about 2 tablespoons of the cream cheese filling into each muffin cup. Return muffin cups to the oven and bake until the filling is set, about 25 minutes. Cool in the pans for 30 minutes then remove the desserts. Remove the foil cover of the prepared frosting and microwave until softened, about 30 seconds. Stir frosting until smooth, then spread about one tablespoon of frosting onto each dessert cup. Refrigerate until set, about 1 hour. This is a mini version of Boston Cream Pie.  They are really easy to make and they are great to bring to parties, cookouts, Christmas, Thanksgiving, and the Super Bowl.  I never have leftovers.

Reduce heat to medium-low and bring to a simmer; about 5 minutes. Add chicken and 1/2 cup Cheddar cheese to the milk mixture; remove immediately from heat and pour over the rotini. Top pasta and sauce mixture with remaining Cheddar cheese. Bake in preheated oven until cheese is melted and beginning to brown, about 25 minutes. Super-easy chicken tetrazzini. Uses rotisserie chicken to save time.
In a medium bowl, mix together cream cheese, dressing mix and mayonnaise. Spread a thin layer of the cream cheese mixture on a slice of bread, and top with a slice of cucumber. Sprinkle with dill.  Repeat with remaining ingredients. I got this recipe years ago from a friend of a friend. I love it and make it all the time for parties. It looks great on the platter, and it is super easy! Everyone loves it!

Flour tortillas filled with a mildly spicy, cheesy, picante chicken and rice mixture, then topped with more cheese and baked. A great dinner inspired by Mexican flavors. This is my favorite chicken recipe!
Blend milk, yogurt, banana, peanut butter, spinach, and ice cubes until smooth. Great post-workout snack that will keep you filled for hours! The taste of the banana and the peanut butter cover the taste of the spinach completely. I freeze my bananas and spinach then prepackage everything for the week! Substitutions include rice or nut milks or vanilla yogurt.
In a large pot of salted boiling water, cook pasta until al dente, rinse under cold water and drain. In a large bowl, combine the tortellini, spinach, cheese, tomatoes and olives.

Mash with a potato masher or with an electric mixer. This is my secret recipe for Garlic Mashed potatoes, reverse engineered from a certain Italian restaurant.  This recipe for 100 servings, I usually cut it down to 10 servings (1 5lb bag of potatoes).  I guarantee that these are the best potatoes you've ever tasted.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan with cooking spray. Spread tomato paste onto beef bones and place in the prepared roasting pan. Bake in the preheated oven until bones begin to brown, about 30 minutes. Transfer bones to a slow cooker and pour in enough water to cover bones. Add onions, carrots, garlic, and bay leaves to broth mixture. Cook on Low for at least 24 hours. Strain broth through a fine-mesh strainer into a container and refrigerate. After bout upon bout of sickness with the start of the school year, a friend showed me her bone broth recipe.

Mix the coffee granules into the hot water, and pour into the sauce; simmer for 30 more minutes. Savory sauce with coffee. He would often smoke Italian sausage, and put it in in the last hour. Make plenty ahead of time, gets richer after a day or two.
In a small bowl, combine the sugar, salt, paprika, mustard, pepper, oregano and thyme. To use: coat meat in mixture, and then grill as desired. This is a tastier alternative to marinating meat. A rub gives a fuller flavor to any meat. This rub can be used for just about any meat (I personally favor it on chicken!). This recipe makes enough for about four servings of meat.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously spray a 9-inch springform pan with cooking spray, and line pan with parchment paper. In a large mixing bowl, beat the egg yolks, honey, vanilla extract, baking soda, and salt together until thoroughly mixed; gently stir in the graham cracker crumbs. In a separate glass or metal bowl, beat the egg whites with an electric mixer until they form stiff peaks. Gently fold the whipped egg whites into the crumb mixture until just combined; do not overmix. Spread the batter into the prepared springform pan. Bake in the preheated oven until the cake is golden brown, about 30 minutes. Allow to cool in pan for 10 minutes before running a knife around the edge of the cake to loosen sides. Release the springform pan, and gently remove cake from the bottom; cool completely on a wire rack.

Cook and stir mushroom mixture until bouillon is dissolved and mushrooms are lightly browned, 10 to 15 more minutes. Stir ricotta cheese into mushroom mixture and remove from heat. Eat this dish as a side or my personal favorite is topping a grilled sirloin or peppered steak with the mushrooms and drippings. You can use whole or sliced mushrooms. Taste and add garlic powder and seasoned salt if you want more of a taste to it.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the green beans and boil 3 to 4 minutes until just tender. Drain beans and immediately plunge into ice water. Allow to sit in ice water until cold, then drain well, and set aside. Cook pancetta in a large skillet over medium-high heat until crispy, then set aside. Reduce heat to medium, stir shallots into the pancetta fat, and cook gently until the shallots have turned dark golden brown, about 10 minutes. Place pancetta and green beans in skillet; toss and cook until warmed through, about 2 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving. Fresh green beans with sweet caramelized shallots and savory Italian pancetta take vegetables to a whole new level.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour an 8 inch square baking pan. Over low heat, melt chocolate and butter in a medium saucepan.  Stir until smooth.  Remove from heat and cool slightly. In a large bowl, beat sugars and eggs until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes with electric mixer).  Add melted chocolate, 3 tablespoons of the Grand Marnier, vanilla and the orange peel, mixing until well blended. Mix in the flour, salt and chocolate chips (on low speed if using an electric mixer). Pour batter into prepared pan.  Smooth the top.  Bake for 30-35 until sides look done and top feels firm.  Inserting a toothpick 2 inches from center should come out clean; however, center will jiggle and look undercooked. Remove from oven and brush top with the remaining 1 tablespoon Grand Marnier.  Cover pan with foil or plastic and cool completely. Cut into 2 inch squares.  Store covered at room temperature or they may be frozen. Defrost covered at room temperature. A brownie for adults.

The perfect margarita made with all fresh ingredients! I love margaritas. Let me rephrase that, I love good margaritas. This recipe took me about 6 months to perfect, and 5 years to share. I promise once you taste the freshness and balance of this recipe, you'll not only impress yourself, but your friends too. This recipe is consistent, and will come out the same exact way every time. Here are some dos and don'ts to make sure it comes out my way, Gerry's way. Use 2 heaping tablespoons white sugar. The most common mistake is people don't use enough white sugar because they think its too much. The drink will be tart. Don't worry most of the sugar stays in the shaker. Let the drink rest after shaking. That little bit of water from the ice melting helps the balance.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until fragrant, about 2 minutes. Season goose with salt and pepper; add to the hot oil.

Puree raspberries and mint leaves in a blender until smooth. Strain into a serving pitcher. Puree the cubed watermelon until smooth, and strain the juice into the serving pitcher. Stir in the margarita mix, coconut rum, and ice cubes. Garnish each glass with mint sprigs. I made this up after looking for an appetizing way to rid myself of an extra watermelon.  Lovely to drink on a hot day!
Pour 1 1/2 cups orange juice into a resealable plastic bag. Add tilapia fillets, coat with the juice, squeeze bag to remove excess air, and seal the bag. Marinate in the refrigerator 3 hours to overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Whisk butter, panko bread crumbs, 3 tablespoons orange juice, garlic, and basil together in a bowl. Remove tilapia from the orange juice and shake to remove excess liquid; arrange fillets in a 13x9-inch baking dish. Discard marinade. Pour 1/2 cup orange juice over the tilapia fillets. Spread butter mixture over the top of the filets to cover each completely. Bake in preheated oven until the liquid is bubbling and the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. Tilapia baked in orange juice with a garlic basil topping.
In a bowl or resealable bag, combine tequila, lime juice, honey, garlic, and cumin; stir or seal the bag and shake until blended. This super quick marinade is great for summer grilling and chilling! I use this recipe to marinate one pound of flank steak, but you can't go wrong with chicken or even firm fleshed fish. Marinate at least an hour, or preferably, overnight.
In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the wine, vinegar, oil, sugar, garlic, bell pepper, red pepper flakes and mushrooms. Bring to a boil, cover and set aside to cool.

Perfect for those days lounging by the pool or out cruising in the boat. Concocted this while looking for something a little different.  Put ours in the freezer and scoop out whenever we get the urge.
Soak bean mix in water overnight. Place drained soaked beans, tomato sauce, tomatoes and chilies, celery, carrots and sausage in slow cooker.  Add enough water to cover all ingredients and season soup to taste with salt, pepper, chicken seasoning, onion powder, and garlic. Simmer on low for 8 to 10 hours until beans are tender. This is an easy soup to prepare and will be ready when you get home.  Enjoy
Mix pineapple and dry pudding mix in medium bowl.  Gently stir in whipped topping. Stack cake layers on plate, spreading pudding mixture between layers and on top of cake. Refrigerate 1 hour or until ready to serve.  Garnish with your favorite seasonal berries. Layers of angel food cake are spread with a creamy vanilla mixture and topped with fresh berries.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 24 muffin cups with paper liners. Bring Irish stout beer and 1 cup butter to a boil in a saucepan and set aside until butter has melted, stirring occasionally. Mix in cocoa powder until smooth. Whisk together flour, sugar, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Beat eggs with sour cream in a large bowl with an electric mixer on low until well combined. Slowly beat in the beer mixture, then the flour mixture; beat until the batter is smooth. Divide batter between the prepared cupcake cups, filling each cup about 2/3 full. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of a cupcake comes out clean, about 17 minutes. Cool the cupcakes completely. Cut cores out of the center of each cupcake with a sharp paring knife. Discard cores. Bring cream to a simmer in a saucepan over low heat; stir in bittersweet chocolate until melted. Mix in 2 tablespoons butter and Irish whiskey until butter is melted; let mixture cool to room temperature. Filling will thicken as it cools. Spoon the filling into the cored cupcakes. For frosting, whip 1/2 cup butter in a bowl with an electric mixer until fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Set mixer to low speed and slowly beat in confectioners' sugar, 1 cup at a time, until frosting is smooth and spreadable. Beat in the Irish cream liqueur; adjust thickness of frosting with more confectioners' sugar if needed. Spread frosting on filled cupcakes. These cupcakes are made from scratch with a stout beer, then filled with an Irish whiskey-chocolate filling and topped off with some Irish cream icing. These are perfect for St. Patrick's Day.
Combine half the garbanzo beans with half the jalapeno, banana, Cubanelle, bell, and serrano peppers in a blender or bowl of a food processor. Add the olive oil, red pepper flakes to taste, cumin, sesame seeds, cayenne pepper, and garlic. Blend or pulse until well mixed. Stir in the remaining garbanzo beans and peppers. Pour in 1 tablespoon reserved garbanzo bean liquid, or amount required, to thin mixture to desired consistency, and blend until smooth. Wake up your tastebuds with this twist on traditional hummus. Five different peppers combined with spices are the perfect complement to pita chips or baked whole wheat crackers. You may seed the peppers if you prefer a little less heat.
Combine the pineapple, Mandarin oranges, marshmallows, and sour cream in a bowl. Gently fold the cornflakes cereal into the mixture. Sprinkle the coconut over the top; stir into the salad just before serving. This is a quick easy to make side dish that is always a hit at hoe-downs and hootenanys. One cup of each ingredient is added so it is easy to remember and fun to make with kids. If you are serving all the kin folk simply add two or three cups of each ingredient. Some folks also add whatever berries are in season to make it sweeter and more colorful for kids.
Melt the butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onion and garlic; season with salt and pepper to taste. Cook and stir until the onion has begun to soften, about 1 minute. Add the pierogies, and cook until slightly browned on each side, about 5 minutes per side. Sprinkle with dried parsley to serve. This is a great side dish for pork or chicken main dishes. This can also be a great idea for an appetizer. This was a recipe that I learned from a friend in high school.
Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Saute onion and prosciutto in hot oil until onion is soft, 5 to 6 minutes. Stir garlic, salt, red pepper flakes, and black pepper into onion mixture; saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Pour chicken broth, tomato sauce, and thyme into onion mixture. Add peas and beans; bring to a boil. Stir penne into broth mixture and cook for 7 minutes; remove from heat. Stir Parmesan cheese into penne mixture, cover the saucepan with a lid, and let sit until the pasta absorbs most of the liquid, about 5 minutes. Inspired by depression-era pasta and peas, I decided to do my own take on this meager macaroni. I hope I'm wrong, but I think the next big thing in the food world is going to be these types of 'frugal fabulous' recipes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix brown sugar, butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg together in a bowl. Cut the core out of each apple leaving the bottom intact to form a well. Stuff each apple with the brown sugar mixture, filling almost to the top. Place a few blueberries on top of the filling and finish with a layer of brown sugar mixture. Press a few raisins into the brown sugar mixture. Pour enough water into a shallow baking dish to cover the bottom; add walnuts, rum, vanilla extract, and cornstarch and mix well. Arrange apples in the water mixture and cover the dish with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven until apples are slightly tender, about 20 minutes. Remove foil and bake until sugar begins to caramelize, water mixture is thickened, and apples are tender, about 15 minutes more. Stir the water mixture and spoon it over the apples. Cool apples for about 5 minutes before serving. I threw this together tonight and it came out great. Not too sweet, just sweet enough! Suggested toppings: vanilla ice cream, creme fraiche, or nonfat vanilla Greek yogurt.
Heat oven to 375 degrees F. Wash the turkey, inside and out, and dry well. Coat inside and outside with olive oil. Season turkey on the outside with salt and pepper, pressing it in to adhere. Place 2 rosemary sprigs, 1 thyme sprig, 1 sage sprig, 1 oregano sprig and lemon halves inside the cavity of the turkey. Place cooling rack or roasting rack in bottom of large roasting pan. Place turkey on rack, and arrange carrots, celery and remaining herbs on bottom of pan around turkey. Pour 4 cups (1 carton) chicken broth and water over vegetables and herbs. Roast until an instant-read thermometer (inserted deep into the thigh but away from the bone) reads 165 degrees F and juices in the thigh run clear when pierced with a fork, about 2 to 2 1/2 hours, basting with pan broth every 30 minutes. Remove turkey from the pan and let rest for 15 minutes before carving. Strain and reserve pan juices, and discard vegetables. While turkey is resting, make the gravy. In a medium heavy saucepan, cook flour and butter over medium heat for 3 to 4 minutes, or until a blond roux is formed. Add pan juices and 4 cups (1 carton) of chicken broth; heat to boiling over high heat. Reduce the heat and let simmer until thickened and ready to serve. Carve turkey as desired, and serve with gravy. Rosemary, thyme, sage, and oregano--fresh herbs bring out the rich flavors of roasted turkey and vegetables served with lots of gravy.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add spaghetti, and cook until al dente, about 5 minutes. Drain, and set aside. While the pasta is getting started, slice sausages lengthwise, and remove the casings. Brown sausages in a large skillet over medium-high heat with a drizzle of the olive oil. Remove sausages to a platter, and keep warm in the oven. Add the bell peppers, garlic, oregano and basil to the skillet, and drizzle with the remaining olive oil. Saute over medium heat until peppers are tender. Toss the pepper mixture with the drained spaghetti until well blended, and season with salt and pepper to taste. Transfer to a serving platter, and arrange the sausages on the top. Garnish with Italian parsley and Parmesan cheese. This dish was inspired by a description in the novel, 'The Godfather.' It is also a favorite with my 'family.' Serve with a crusty bread, a green salad, and a robust dry red wine for a very satisfying meal. The amount of oil and garlic can be adjusted to your taste.
Cook the bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Crumble the bacon and set aside. Place a steamer insert into a saucepan and fill with water to just below the bottom of the steamer. Cover and bring the water to a boil. Add the asparagus, cover, and steam until bright green but still crunchy, about 5 minutes. Remove asparagus and set aside. In a large bowl, whisk together eggs, milk, dry mustard, salt, and pepper until smooth and well combined. Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Layer the bread slices into the bottom of the dish, cutting and fitting extra slices as needed to fill spaces. Sprinkle 1 cup of Cheddar cheese over the bread, followed by the diced onion. Arrange asparagus spears and red bell pepper in a layer over the onion. Sprinkle crumbled bacon over the red bell pepper; top with another layer of bread slices, cutting and filling in spaces as before. Pour the egg-milk mixture evenly over the casserole, and refrigerate overnight. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake the casserole for 50 minutes; sprinkle 1 cup shredded Cheddar cheese over the top of the casserole, return to the oven, and bake until the cheese is melted and bubbling and a knife inserted into the center of the casserole comes out clean, 10 to 15 more minutes. I made this for my family last Easter and it was devoured. It is easy to assemble and tastes great. A real family pleaser.
Place the avocados and melted butter in a mixing bowl.  Blend with an immersion blender until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Scrape the mixture into a saucepan and stir over low heat. Pour in the Irish cream and stir. Add the cocoa powder and stir until completely incorporated.  Stir in the confectioners' sugar 1 cup at a time, making sure the sugar is completely incorporated and the mixture is smooth before adding the next cup. Melt the semi-sweet chocolate and white chocolate in a microwave-safe glass or ceramic bowl in 30-second intervals, stirring after each melting, for 1 to 3 minutes (depending on your microwave).  Do not overheat or chocolate will scorch. Pour the melted chocolate into the sauce pan and mix thoroughly. Remove from the heat. Line a 9X11-inch pan with wax paper or foil sprayed with cooking spray.  Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared pan.  Chill in the refrigerator for at least 1 hour. Although avocados seem like a strange ingredient for fudge, they give a great creamy texture to a decadent treat.  I often give it as a gift for the holidays and no one can ever believe it's made with avocados!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter an 8x8 inch pan. In a medium bowl, mix cheese and sugar until soft. Add eggs one at a time, mixing thoroughly with each addition. Add vanilla and mix to incorporate. Pour into prepared 8x8 inch pan. If desired, sprinkle top lightly with cinnamon. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Cake will appear to be soft in the center. Allow to cool and it will set. Quick, easy, and lower in fat than most traditional cheesecakes.
Mince enough of the red onion slices to have 1/3 cup minced onion. Put remaining onion slices in a bowl and pour vinegar over them; marinate for 10 minutes. Drain and discard the vinegar. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Season pork chops with salt and pepper; fry in the hot oil until nicely browned and no longer pink in the center, about 4 minutes per side. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Arrange pork chops onto serving plates; top each with a portion of the red onion slices. Whisk minced onion, sour cream, Dijon mustard, and apricot preserves together in a bowl; serve with the pork chops. I love mustard! The pickled onion rings are a nice side, but you can skip it for another type of condiment, like olives or pickles.
Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium high heat. Add onions and turmeric and saute; when onions are brown, add chicken and saute for about 10 minutes, or until chicken is almost cooked through. Add tomato paste, water and salt and pepper to taste. Stir together, reduce heat and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes, during which the 'gravy' should thicken. Meanwhile, put carrots in a small saucepan; add sugar and cook until carrots are soft to caramelize. When cooked, drain carrots. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a small skillet over medium heat, add carrots and saute. Set aside. Heat remaining 3 tablespoons of vegetable oil in a large skillet, add potatoes and fry. (If desired, add a pinch of turmeric and a pinch of salt.) Add carrots and potatoes to chicken, stir all together and serve. Chicken thighs prepared with onions and tomato paste, seasoned with turmeric and stirred together with carrots and potatoes. Serve hot over cooked white rice, if desired. Make sure that a nice amount of the chicken 'gravy' is served on the rice!
Pour half a shot of butterscotch schnapps, then fill the other half with Irish cream. A nice sweet alcoholic shot for parties or get togethers
Melt 4 tablespoons of butter in a large skillet over low heat. Add the onions; cook and stir until they turn a deep brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the garlic, and cook for 2 minutes, until fragrant. Mix in the chicken stock and rosemary, and increase the heat to medium-high. Cook until reduced by 1/3, about 8 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti pasta, and cook until tender, about 8 minutes. Drain, then add noodles to the sauce in the skillet. Stir in the remaining butter and Parmesan cheese. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in a large bowl family style, or place about 1 cup of pasta in a large mug or small bowl. Insert a dinner fork in the center of the pasta and twirl the fork around, holding the mug steady. The pasta will wind up tighter and tighter as you turn. Remove the fork and immediately turn the pasta out onto a dinner plate or shallow bowl. Garnish with extra cheese and rosemary sprigs. My mother has been making this dish for as long as I can remember. Lots of rosemary and garlic - what more could you ask for?
Heat a large pot over medium-high heat. Crumble ground beef into the skillet; cook and stir until the beef is completely browned, 5 to 7 minutes. Drain and discard any excess grease. Stir zucchini, potatoes, Anaheim chile peppers, onion, bay leaves, beef bouillon granules, salt, and black pepper into the ground beef. Pour enough water over the mixture to cover by 2 to 3 inches. Bring the mixture to a simmer over medium-low heat; cook at a simmer until the potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes. Whisk 1/3 cup water and cornstarch together in a small bowl. Slowly pour the cornstarch slurry into the stew while stirring. Continue cooking until thickened, about 5 minutes. Stir Worcestershire sauce into the stew; season with salt and black pepper. My Dad took the veggies I had brought him from a friend's garden and just invented this one morning. His original recipe used Boca® crumbles. I like to make it with hamburger or ground turkey. This recipe was invented as vegetarian. You can add more Anaheims for a spicier stew.
Mix flour and salt together until blended. Make a well in the flour, add the milk, and whisk until consistent. Beat the eggs into the batter. Add water and beat again until the mixture is light and frothy. Set aside for an hour (or, if it's the day before, cover in the fridge overnight). If the batter has been refrigerated, allow it to come up to room temperature before using.  When the roast beef is ready to come out of the oven, ready the mixture. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Pour off drippings from roast beef and measure out desired amount (about 1/2 cup should do). Pour drippings into a 9x12 inch baking dish and place into the oven until the drippings sizzle. Pour the batter over the drippings and bake for 30 minutes (or until the sides have risen and are golden brown). Cut into eight portions and serve immediately. A yummy and traditional addition to the holiday feast. If you intend to make this, the timing has to be juuuuust right. I would suggest preparing the mixture the evening before, and having it ready while the roast beef is cooking. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place Parmesan cheese, olive oil, onion powder, garlic powder, pepper, salt, and potatoes into a resealable plastic bag. Seal the bag, then shake to coat the potatoes with the seasoning. Spread the potatoes over a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, about 25 minutes. Family favorite french fries that go great with hotdogs or burgers.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a 2 quart casserole dish. In a saucepan, bring water to boil and add the 1/2 teaspoon salt.  Slowly add the cornmeal and cook over low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring constantly. Pour 2/3 of the hot cornmeal mush into a 2 quart casserole dish. Using the spoon, bring it up the sides as far as it will reach.  If mush is too thick to spread, add a little boiling water. In a large frying pan, cook, but don't brown, the ground beef, breaking it up into crumbs as it cooks. Add onion and green pepper and cook 5 minutes longer. Add corn (with its liquid), chili powder, salt and tomato sauce, heat until very hot and pour mixture into the casserole dish lined with cornmeal mush. Spoon remaining cornmeal mush over top.  Again, it should be thin enough to spread, but certainly not watery. Top with grated cheese and bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 35 to 40 minutes, or until cheese is melted and browned. This is an economical and tasty main course pie.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lay yams skin side down in a 9x12 inch baking dish.  Pour maple syrup over the yams and sprinkle with nutmeg and cinnamon.

Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). Stir together the cranberries, sugar, and liqueur in a baking dish. Bake in preheated oven for 1 1/2 hours, stirring every 20 minutes. Store refrigerated in a tightly-covered container. Becky's mom's recipe is so good that even anyone who says they do not like cranberries will love it! This sauce is fantastic. It should be made at least 2 weeks before use. However, I've made it the day before and it was still really good.
Combine 3/4 cup mayonnaise, ketchup, warm water, and vinegar in a large bowl and mix well. Stir in chopped gherkins, cocktail onions, diced apple, and shredded carrot. Add corned beef, mashed potatoes, and salt and pepper to taste; mix well. Form the potato salad on a plate as a loaf or a round mound.

Great recipe to finish up corned beef and potato leftovers! It's hearty and savory with a zesty sweet tang to it. Normally served for parties but can be served as a side dish for lunch or appetizer. Serve with fresh white or brown bread rolls.
Combine margarine and cream cheese in large bowl; beat with mixer at medium speed until smooth and creamy.  Beat in vanilla. Combine flour and salt in small bowl; gradually add to margarine mixture, beating until mixture forms soft dough. Divide dough in half; wrap each half in plastic wrap. Refrigerate until firm.

Roll dough into 1-inch balls and arrange 2 inches apart on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until the bottoms of the cookies are golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. This is a great vegan Cinco de Mayo recipe. Feel free to use other nuts besides pecans or use mixed nuts!
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Add onions; cook and stir until tender. Place the green beans into a large pot with about 1 inch of water. Bring to a boil, and cook for 5 minutes. Add the cabbage to the pot, and top with the cooked onion. Season with sweetener and salt, then top with bratwurst. Dot with remaining butter. Cook uncovered over low heat for 30 minutes. Stir, and serve. This unusual combination of ingredients in a pot came to us through a friend by way of her mother. Our friend's mom takes food to families who have suffered a death in the family.  They take all sorts of things but this always goes first. It is tasty. She uses kielbasa but we use brats. We also use Splenda instead of sugar. It freezes and reheats well.
Combine olive oil, mustard, vinegar, salt, and pepper in a Mason jar or container with a tight-fitting lid; cover tightly with the lid and shake vigorously until thickened, about 2 minutes. Taste dressing and adjust flavor with salt and pepper. This is great for creating a small amount of a great dressing for any salad greens, but mesclun greens seem to go with this really well.
In a large resealable bag, mix together the soy sauce, minced garlic, and pepper. Place the pork chops into the bag, squeeze out most of the air, seal, and marinate for 12 hours in the refrigerator. Turn the bag over about halfway through. Preheat the oven's broiler. Place the pork chops onto a broiling pan. Broil for 5 minutes per side, or to your desired doneness. Time will be different depending on the thickness of your chops. This is he most moist pork chops you will ever have!  Even my three boys ages 7 and under eat them all up.  It is so easy and actually so healthy. Great served with some rice, noodles or any vegetables.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a broiler pan or other pan with rack. Mix together the baking mix, sausage, Cheddar cheese, Parmesan cheese, milk, and parsley.

Peel and slice apples. Toss with sugars, cinnamon, and flour. Set aside. Roll pie crust dough to make slightly larger than 10-inch glass pie pan. Fit bottom crust in pie pan. Turn in apple mixture and dot with butter. Put crust on top and crimp edges of crust together. Wet hands with water and dampen top of pie. Sprinkle with additional sugar. Puncture top of pie with fork so pie will vent. Bake for 15 minutes at 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking for about 45 minutes more, until crust is golden brown. It's a good practice to place a piece of aluminum foil slightly larger than the pie under the pie plate to catch overflows. Serve warm. Everyone in the family has something that they're the best at making. I make the best cookies, my sister, Carol, makes the best pies in the whole world!  . . . no competition in our family! This recipe includes an ingredient called free flowing brown sugar. This is a non-clumping or caking version of ordinary brown sugar. It has a lower moisture content then the traditional one, which makes it free flowing much like granulated sugar. It is available at most specialty supermarket. If it is not available in your part of the world, use regular brown sugar and make sure it is broken up, free of clumps. Originally submitted to ThanksgivingRecipe.com.
Heat the barbeque sauce, both steak sauces, apple butter, onion, jalapeno pepper (if desired), garlic, Worcestershire sauce, liquid smoke, grill seasoning, allspice, cloves, salt, and black pepper in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir until mixture is warmed through, then reduce heat to low and cook until onions are translucent, about 4 to 5 minutes more. Reserve 2/3 to 1 cup of the sauce to use for dipping, while the remaining sauce can be used to baste while grilling. This sauce is sweet, spicy, and I have yet to find something it doesn't taste wonderful slathered all over. And the extra flavor from the apple butter gives it just the extra boost to make it absolutely wonderful.

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease two 2-cup baking dishes. Bring the clam juice to a simmer in a small pot. Place salmon fillet into clam juice; poach until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 10 minutes. Remove salmon to a plate; reserve poaching liquid. Heat olive oil and butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in carrot, celery, leek, and shallot; cook and stir until vegetables are tender, about 5 minutes. Whisk flour into vegetable mixture; cook and stir until flour is golden, about 5 minutes. Whisk reserved poaching liquid and cream into vegetable mixture; return to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens, about 3 minutes. Stir dill and lemon juice into mixture; season with salt and pepper. Break salmon fillet into bite-size pieces; divide into prepared baking dishes. Cover salmon with 1/3 the sauce; layer 5 shrimp into each dish. Cover shrimp with 1/3 the sauce; divide smoked salmon evenly into each dish. Top with remaining 1/3 the sauce. Roll out puff pastry sheet 1/8-inch thick on a lightly floured surface. Cut two pastry circles large enough to cover the baking dishes and place one circle over each dish. Place dishes on a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until pastry is risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Cool for 5 minutes before serving. I was looking to make some warm comfort food on a cold winter day. I was thinking chicken pot pie but wanted to try something different, though along the same lines - served in a individual baking dish with a creamy sauce, and topped with puff pastry. Sounds like chicken pot pie but I wanted salmon! I looked at some fish pie recipes but nothing I found came in that familiar comforting form. So I set out on my own and this is what I came up with! Hope you enjoy it.
Blend cucumbers, zucchini, onion, olive oil, basil leaves, and lemon juice together in a blender until smooth; add cream, salt, and pepper and pulse until smooth.

Do not lift can during cooking. Brush the charcoal off of the can, and lift off carefully as some heat may rush out when you lift the can. The internal temperature of the turkey should be at least 180 degrees F (83 degrees C) when taken in the thickest part of the thigh. Not the conventional way of cooking a turkey, but the results are amazing and the bird tastes wonderful. Seasoning can be added, but is not necessary.
In a medium bowl, mix cream cheese, mayonnaise, onion juice and grated onion. Spread the mixture thinly on the white bread slices. Roll 1 baby dill pickle in each slice of bread.

Ladle the stew over the drained noodles to serve. A flavorful stew, Pörkölt is redolent with the fragrance of paprika and bell peppers. It has few ingredients, and is surprisingly easy to make. Save time by using boneless pork chops and cubing them after they are browned. There should be enough salt in the canned tomatoes to season the stew, but if not, add more to your taste. Use best-quality, real Hungarian paprika for best results. We prefer to serve it with noodles, but galuska (Hungarian dumplings) or rice are good, too.
Put chicken pieces in a large stockpot; pour enough water over chicken to cover completely. Add onion, celery, bouillon cubes, basil, parsley, garlic, salt, and pepper to the pot; bring to a simmer over medium-high heat.

Grandpa sends me veggies from his huge garden every year and I use 'em for this soup, which has been called 'the best soup I've ever eaten' by friends. It's pretty unstructured and can change to meet your personal tastes. It's basically a chicken veggie soup; it's the FRESH veggies that make it the best. I just throw stuff in until it looks and tastes the way I want it to. It's also GREAT if you're sick; I swear it'll cure what ails ya! YUM! The longer you SLOWLY cook the soup, the more flavorful it becomes. I often eat a bowl while it's simmering 'cause I can't wait.
Heat vegetable oil in a large stockpot over medium heat; cook and stir onion and garlic in the hot oil until onion is softened and translucent, about 10 minutes. Add water, chicken base, potatoes, carrots, bok choy, and celery; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer until vegetables are slightly tender, about 10 minutes. Add chicken; continue simmering until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 10 minutes. I bought bok choy with no idea how to use it. Threw it in a simple chicken and veggie soup, and the family loved it! 4 cans low-sodium chicken broth can be substituted for the 6 cups water and chicken base.
Cook and stir bacon in a large, deep skillet over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a paper towel-lined plate, reserving bacon grease in skillet.

Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; stir in flour and cook until a thick paste forms, about 1 minute. Whisk paste into chicken mixture until sauce is thickened, 1 to 2 minutes. My take on the classic French dish. I loved to experiment and didn't follow a recipe. I know the main idea was braising chicken in wine, and you need to flavor to your tastes. Thyme and rosemary always go great with chicken, and bacon...well it's bacon. My favorite side dish is mashed potatoes and French/Italian bread to soak up the juices. One time I forgot I didn't have potatoes, so on the fly I shredded the chicken, tossed the bones, and we had a great soup/stew on a cold night. A lot of flavor with very little work. Enjoy.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x12-inch baking dish.

Place a tortilla down onto a work surface, and spoon 1/4 of the turkey mixture onto the tortilla in a line down the center. Roll the tortilla around the filling; place into the prepared baking dish with seam side down. Repeat with the other tortillas. Pour the tomato sauce over the filled tortillas. Sprinkle the casserole with black olives and 1 tablespoon of Cheddar cheese as garnish. Bake uncovered in the preheated oven until the cheese topping is browned and the casserole is bubbling, about 30 minutes. My husband's favorite meal is roast turkey - my favorite is playing with the leftovers! These can be made with cooked turkey or chicken.
Mix together 1/2 cup olive oil, wine mixed with salt, chopped leek, dill, rose petals, coriander, and black pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large pan.  Fry whole chicken over medium heat.  Add about half of the seasoning mixture, and continue to fry until chicken just starts to change color. Place chicken in a baking dish large enough to hold it along with the seasoning mixture--both what was in the pan and what you didn't use.  Rub the bird with the mixture for a minute or so. Bake at 425 degrees F (220 degrees C) for 1 hour, occasionally basting with the seasoning mixture. The chicken will look almost burnt when done. Moisten a plate with fig syrup, place chicken on it.  Season with salt and pepper. When I was preparing this dish, I was certain I would never do it again because I disliked handling the chicken so much. After tasting it, however, I'm certain I'm going to make it again, as it is some of the best chicken I've ever had. This is an ancient Roman recipe from the book of Apicus, so some ingredients are hard to find or I am uncertain as to what they actually are.  For Saturei I used dried rose petals, for Liquamen I used 1 cup wine plus 1 tbs salt, and instead of Defritum (fig syrup), you can use sweet and tangy steak sauce.
Place 1 cookie in each of 30 paper-lined muffin cups. Prepare cake batter as directed on package; spoon 1 heaping tablespoon over each cookie. (All batter will not be used.)

Cut the remaining crust into 3/4-inch wide strips (use a scalloped edge pastry cutter for a prettier crust). Moisten the rim of the filled bottom crust with a bit of water, and lay the two longest strips in a cross in the middle of the pie. Working from the next longest down to the shortest strips, alternate horizontal and vertical strips, weaving the strips as you go. Press the lattice strips down onto the bottom crust edge to seal, and trim the top crust strips neatly. Brush the crust with milk, and sprinkle with 1 tablespoon of sugar. Cover pie edges with aluminum foil strips. Bake pie in preheated oven for 15 minutes; lower temperature to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C), and bake until the filling is bubbling and the crust is golden brown, about 40 minutes.

An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). My family wasn't that thrilled with the taste of turkey burgers and I was watching my intake of beef. I started experimenting with ground chicken in my burgers and was mildly surprised with the outcome. The family likes these better than beef burgers!

Based on the ingredients of the lula kebab, this Middle Eastern-derived recipe uses ground lamb, carrots, and white beans to create a tasty stew-like dish for serving over rice. It's good for those one-bowl meals and reheats well. The flavors get even better after a day. Add more meat and fewer beans if you like a meatier dish. Also, you can mix in beef with lamb, but the lamb flavor is essential. I like cumin, but you can always take away the spice, or try adding a minced serrano chili pepper or two for some heat. 
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Season pork chops with salt and pepper to taste, and arrange in a medium oven safe skillet. Top pork chops with onions, sweet potatoes, and apples. Sprinkle with brown sugar. Season with 2 teaspoons pepper and 1 teaspoon salt. Cover, and bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, until sweet potatoes are tender and pork chops have reached an internal temperature of 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). This is so easy, so good, and so versatile! I've used pork chops with and without bones, pork loin, and pork roast. You can sprinkle the brown sugar, salt, and pepper on the different layers or all at the end, as mentioned in the recipe.  Play around with the brown sugar and spices to your taste.
Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat; cook and stir the potatoes in the butter until browned, about 10 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Add the onion and cook until the potatoes are tender, another 3 to 5 minutes. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the cilantro, green onion, and curry powder; mix and cook another 2 to 3 minutes. This American-South Asian breakfast fusion is surprisingly good with ketchup. I ate mine with fried eggs, bacon, toast, and candied tamarind.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Grease and flour an 8 inch square baking pan. Over low heat, melt chocolate and butter in a medium saucepan.  Stir until smooth.  Remove from heat and cool slightly. In a large bowl, beat sugars and eggs until light and fluffy (about 2 minutes with electric mixer).  Add melted chocolate, 3 tablespoons of the Grand Marnier, vanilla and the orange peel, mixing until well blended. Mix in the flour, salt and chocolate chips (on low speed if using an electric mixer). Pour batter into prepared pan.  Smooth the top.  Bake for 30-35 until sides look done and top feels firm.  Inserting a toothpick 2 inches from center should come out clean; however, center will jiggle and look undercooked. Remove from oven and brush top with the remaining 1 tablespoon Grand Marnier.  Cover pan with foil or plastic and cool completely. Cut into 2 inch squares.  Store covered at room temperature or they may be frozen. Defrost covered at room temperature. A brownie for adults.
In small bowl, beat egg whites, vanilla, cream of tartar, peppermint extract (if using) and salt till soft peaks form. Very gradually add sugar; bet till very stiff peaks form.

Pour chicken broth and water into a large soup pot and bring to a boil. Place chicken into the boiling mixture, breast side down; drop tea bags into the liquid. Reduce heat to low, cover, and simmer chicken for 45 minutes, turning chicken over in the broth after 30 minutes. Remove chicken from broth, transfer rice stuffing to a bowl, and cut chicken into quarters. Discard tea bags; strain broth, reserving any rice. Stir in soy sauce to taste and season to taste with salt. Serve chicken on a platter garnished with cilantro, with broth and rice stuffing on the side. A new way to cook a whole chicken. It's a one-pot meal that's very satisfying and warming.
Blend the ice, banana, maple syrup, brown sugar, eggnog, orange juice, and vanilla yogurt together in a blender until smooth. A tropical delight that hits a sweet tooth, but reminds you of sunbathing in the tropics. After reading the ingredients it doesn't sound very good, but it is awesome. My favorite smoothie by far. Created by a friend of mine.

My friend served it when we visited in Minnesota and it's been one of our family favorites ever since!
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt or tube pan. Beat 1 cup butter, cream cheese, 1 cup sugar, and 1/2 cup dark brown sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Mix in 1 teaspoon vanilla and 1/4 cup bourbon. Sift together flour, 6 tablespoons cocoa powder, baking powder, and salt and set aside. Prepare the filling: combine 1/4 cup butter, 1/4 cup cocoa powder, 3/4 cup brown sugar in a food processor and pulse to combine. Transfer to a bowl and mix in pecan pieces and 1 tablespoon bourbon; set aside. Gradually add flour mixture to cake batter; beat on medium speed about 3 minutes. Spread half of the batter in bottom of the prepared pan and place teaspoonfuls of pecan filling around the center of batter. Cover with the remaining batter. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted in the cake comes out clean, 55 to 70 minutes. Let cool on wire rack for about 20 minutes. Invert cake onto a serving plate and allow it to cool completely before glazing. For the glaze: sift 1/4 cup cocoa powder with 1 cup confectioners' sugar. Mix in 1 teaspoon vanilla, 1 tablespoon of butter, and 4 tablespoons hot water; add 1 to 2 more tablespoons water until desired consistency is reached. Spoon glaze over top of cooled cake. This recipe came to me via a friend, Bertha, who just loved any cake that had booze in it. I have, in the past, eliminated the bourbon when making this for kids and it is still wonderful. Basically, it is a variation on a tunnel of fudge cake.

Spoon the batter into the prepared muffin cups. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool in the pans 10 to 15 minutes before removing from pan to cool completely on a wire rack. Tried these out during Thanksgiving. They were a big hit!
Season roast with salt and pepper on all sides; coat roast with flour (reserve leftover flour for gravy). Melt shortening in a pressure cooker over medium-high heat. Brown roast on all sides in hot shortening. Sprinkle  onion soup mix over the roast. Pour in at least two cups of water; use 1 to 2 cups more if the beef is a tough cut or to reach the minimum amount recommended by the pressure cooker's manufacturer. Seal the lid and bring the cooker up to full pressure over high heat. Reduce the heat to low, maintaining full pressure, and cook for 1 1/2 to 2 hours. Release the pressure and test for doneness; the meat should be fork-tender. Add potatoes and onions, making sure the vegetables are submerged in the cooking liquid. (You may need to rearrange the roast on top of the vegetables or add more water.) Seal the lid and return the pressure cooker to full pressure. Reduce heat to low, maintaining full pressure, and cook for 10 minutes. Release the pressure; transfer meat and vegetables to a serving platter. To make gravy, bring the cooking liquid to a boil. Whisk reserved flour into 1/2 cup cold water; whisk the flour mixture into the boiling broth. Cook until thickened, stirring occasionally, about 3 minutes. Serve gravy with pot roast and vegetables. A pressure cooker is a must for making a tough roast tender. In our large family when I was growing up, this was everyone's most-requested birthday dinner. When my mother was reducing her household size for a move, she gave me her pressure cooker, and I am now teaching my children to make this favorite as well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking dish. Beat sugar, peanut butter, vanilla extract, and salt together in a bowl until smooth and creamy.

Spread batter into the prepared baking dish using your hands or a spoon. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is dry and the edges have started to pull away from the sides of the pan, about 25 minutes. I was wondering if I could use PB instead of egg in brownies. I couldn't find much online, so I came up with my own. I worked with my favorite brownie recipe and got this recipe. They do have a vegan taste and the dough will seem wrong, but I was happy with the final product!

Turn heat to low; simmer until sugar is dissolved and the flavors are blended, 10 to 15 minutes. Stir cranberries into the saucepan, turn heat to high, and bring to a boil. Cook, stirring constantly, until cranberries begin to pop, 5 to 10 minutes. Reduce heat to low, and cook until sauce begins to thicken, about 5 minutes. Remove cinnamon sticks and cloves. Pour into shallow dish to cool and serve. This is my absolute favorite cranberry sauce.  The apple cider and hint of orange combined with the warm spices just makes it special.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Hold basil bunch by the stems and dip basil leaves in boiling water until bright green, about 2 seconds. Immediately immerse basil in ice water for several minutes until cold to stop the cooking process. Once the basil is cold, drain well. Remove basil leaves from stems and discard stems. Blend basil leaves, 1 cup chicken broth, 1/2 cup olive oil, and garlic together in a blender until smooth. Stir fettuccine into the same pot of boiling water, bring back to a boil, and cook pasta over medium heat until cooked through but still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain. Heat remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir leek and green onion in hot oil until softened, about 5 minutes. Add jalapeno and salt; cook and stir until jalapeno is soft, about 5 minutes. Increase heat to medium-high.

Toss mixture briefly to combine and tightly wrap bowl with aluminum foil. Let stand until pasta and vegetables soak up most of the juices and oil, about 5 minutes. Toss again. Pasta primavera is quite a straightforward recipe; spaghetti or fettuccine tossed with an array of fresh spring vegetables. When done right, this is one of the year's great seasonal recipes. This looks, smells, and tastes like a cool, sunny spring day.

Cover jar and shake vigorously for 2 minutes to form temporary emulsion. Vibrant and fruity, this dressing requires no whisking, drizzling, or machinery of any kind, just a jar with a lid. This 'make and shake' method should be used only if you are going to eat your salad right away.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a 9x13 inch baking dish, combine the cream of chicken soup, cream of mushroom soup, sour cream and sherry. Mix all together. Add the chicken breasts and immerse them in the sauce. Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, for about 45 minutes or until chicken is cooked through (no longer pink inside). This is a creamy, rich tasting chicken bake that is amazingly easy. The sauce is also great over mashed potatoes. For a low-fat dish, substitute reduced fat soups and sour cream.
In a saucepan, combine the coconut milk, water and black-eyed peas. Stir in rice. Bring to a boil, cover and reduce heat to low. Simmer until rice has absorbed all of the liquid, about 40 minutes.

Gently lay the salmon into the hot oil with the skin side facing up and cook until the the flesh side is golden brown, 5 to 7 minutes; turn and continue cooking until the skin side is slightly browned, about 5 minutes more. Remove the salmon from the skillet, allowing any oil to drain from the fish back into the pan. Remove the skin from the salmon fillets; fry the skin in the oil remaining in the skillet until crispy, 2 to 3 minutes. Serve the crispy skin with the salmon. This is a simple way to prepare tasty wild salmon!

About 1/2 hour before serving, place the cream cheese into a bowl, and stir in about 1 tablespoon of the chili liquid until thoroughly combined. Continue stirring in chili broth, a tablespoon at a time, until the cream cheese is almost a liquid. Stir the cream cheese mixture back into the chili. Green chili is a Colorado favorite, it's always a crowd pleaser when we have out-of-state visitors.  Roasting your veggies first gives this recipe a deeper level of flavor. This can be served over rice as a main course, stuffed in enchiladas, or over potatoes and eggs.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place tortellini in the pot, and cook for 7 to 8 minutes, until al dente. Drain, and cool.

Place pumpkin into the cooker, and cover. Cook the stew on the High setting for 1 hour; reduce cooker setting to Low, and cook until pumpkin is tender, 3 to 4 more hours. Season with salt and black pepper. If stew seems too liquid, mix cornstarch into water in a small cup until smooth, and stir the slurry into the stew. Cook until thickened, about 30 minutes. I needed to use up some chicken, and we had been given a lot of pumpkins...so I began to look for a recipe which would take advantage of my ingredients. However, everything I found was quite spicy and knew would not go over well with my grandchildren. I then came across a recipe which seemed to have promise, and used it as the basis for creating this...a new family favorite! I hope you enjoy as much as my family did.
Combine flour, paprika, and 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper in a large, resealable plastic bag; shake to mix. Add beef and shake to coat beef in flour mixture. Remove beef from bag and shake to remove any excess flour mixture. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Cook beef in hot oil until browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove beef with a slotted spoon to a slow cooker, retaining oil and drippings in the skillet. Saute onion in retained drippings until soft and translucent, 5 to 7 minutes; add to beef in slow cooker.

Top with remaining sliced eggplant and spread with mozzarella cheese and 1 tablespoon Parmesan cheese. Cover baking dish with aluminum foil. Bake in preheated oven for 20 minutes and remove foil. Continue baking until cheese is melted, about 5 minutes more. I've changed the recipe to make it spicier plus added ricotta cheese to make it more hearty. If spicy is not your thing, you can get diced tomatoes with green chilies in a mild version.
Mix pumpkin puree, sugar, and pumpkin pie spice together in a large bowl. Slowly whisk in milk, then whipping cream, then vanilla extract. Refrigerate to allow flavors to blend, 2 hours to overnight. Transfer pumpkin mixture into an ice cream maker; churn for 15 to 20 minutes. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches 'soft-serve' consistency. Transfer ice cream to a lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, ice cream should 'bloom' in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight. I looked around here for a pumpkin pie ice cream and couldn't find a 'from scratch' recipe, so I made this one up!
Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate.

Bake in the preheated oven for about 45 minutes, until the meatloaf is cooked all the way through and the top is browned. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). I make salsa from my garden, then can for later, and use to make this awesome meatloaf. I use garlic, fresh tomatoes, peppers and onions all from my garden. You can use commercially-made salsa, too.

The temperature of the mixture should be at 220 degrees F (105 degrees C) so the jam will set. Sterilize the jars and lids in boiling water for at least 5 minutes. Pack the jam into the hot, sterilized jars, filling the jars to within 1/4 inch of the top. Run a knife or a thin spatula around the insides of the jars after they have been filled to remove any air bubbles. Wipe the rims of the jars with a moist paper towel to remove any food residue. Top with lids, and screw on rings. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil over high heat, then carefully lower the jars into the pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between the jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary until the water level is at least 1 inch above the tops of the jars. Bring the water to a full boil, cover the pot, and process for 10 minutes. A wonderful watermelon preserve that will keep the flavor of summer handy all year. Great on toast or English muffins.

Courtesy of us old-time students from Fenelon Falls - this is how I ate poutine almost every day in my high school days (oh, the memories!). People say real poutine must have mozzarella cheese curds - I emphatically disagree! In every restaurant I've been to in Ontario, they use shredded cheese. If you're like me and prefer the English-Canadian version (non-cheese curds) and want to try something different, try this!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Mix sausage, ground turkey, eggs, Cheddar cheese, onion, and black pepper in a large bowl; roll into 1 1/2-inch balls. Arrange meatballs onto baking sheets. Bake in preheated oven until no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, 18 to 20 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). These meatballs with spicy Italian turkey sausage, spicy Italian ground turkey, Cheddar cheese, egg, onion, and seasoning are great for snack or in your spaghetti. I use these as a great snack item. I use small snack-size bags, place three in each bag, and freeze. I'll have one serving of three as a snack by removing them from snack bag and reheating them for 60 to 75 seconds.
Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium heat; saute onion until softened, about 5 minutes. Add garlic and saute until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir chickpeas with liquid from can, lemon juice, coriander, cumin, garam masala, and curry powder into onion mixture; bring to a boil. Reduce heat and simmer, stirring often, until liquid is mostly evaporated and sauce is thickened, 15 to 20 minutes. Stir spinach into sauce and simmer until wilted, about 5 more minutes. This version of chana masala uses spinach instead of tomatoes, like my favorite Indian restaurant makes. It is so easy to throw together, and pretty healthy to boot! A perfect meal on a cold winter night when served with naan and basmati rice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place sausage in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain, and spread evenly in the bottom of a 9x13 inch pan.

Place sweet potato wedges in the bag, and toss to coat. Arrange coated sweet potato wedges on the prepared baking sheet. Bake 20 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, until browned and crisp. This is a recipe I made while attempting to finish a food tech assignment. This also works well with regular potatoes. Sweet potatoes are known as 'kumara' in New Zealand where I am from. Serve with sour cream.
Place the sliced strawberries into a mixing bowl and stir in 1 cup of sugar. Cover, and refrigerate 2 hours to overnight. Stir the strawberries occasionally. The longer they sit in the syrup, the more syrup you will have. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 9x13-inch baking dish. Whisk the flour together with cornstarch, and baking powder in a mixing bowl. Beat the egg yolks in a small bowl with the vanilla extract until smooth; set aside. Whip the egg whites with an electric mixer until very stiff. Slowly add the 1 1/4 cup sugar to the egg whites, a few tablespoons at a time, until the sugar is incorporated and the whites are stiff. Fold in the yolk mixture until almost fully blended into the whites. Fold in the flour mixture until just combined. A few small lumps of flour should remain. Scrape the batter into the prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 22 to 25 minutes. Cool in the pan for 5 minutes, then invert the cake onto a sheet of waxed paper, and cut into 8 equal pieces. While the cake is cooling, whip the heavy cream with the confectioners' sugar to soft peaks. To assemble the strawberry shortcakes: cut each cake square in half horizontally, and put the bottom halves onto dessert plates. Spoon on the strawberries and syrup, then top with the cake tops. Spoon on whipped cream to serve. As a teenager (born and raised in Germany) I made what we call Biskuitteig weekly, which is similar to sponge cake. I never really liked Bisquick for shortcake and remembered the spongy, tender texture of the Biskuitteig. I altered an old German recipe and came up with this delicious version. Also good with other fruit toppings!
TO PREPARE GAME HENS: Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Sprinkle lime juice on hens, then sprinkle on the chili powder, cumin, salt and ground black pepper. Splash olive oil over hens.

TO MAKE SALSA: Combine the corn, red onion, garlic, red bell pepper, jalapeno pepper, lime juice, lemon juice, cilantro, cumin, salt, ground black pepper and olive oil. Mix well and let sit for at least 30 minutes. Put on a platter and top with the cooked hens. Garnish with fresh cilantro and serve. 'Game' is a term applied to wild animals or birds that are deemed suitable for human consumption, or EDIBLE! Young game hens are the best for this delicious lime basted and Southwestern salsafied dish. Get yer spurs on and dig in!
Drain and reserve liquid from salmon. Mix egg, onion, bread crumbs and salmon together. Make into patties. If mixture is too dry to form into patties, add reserved liquid from salmon. In a  frying pan, heat olive oil. Place patties in pan.  Brown on each side, turning gently.  Drain on paper towels and serve. These salmon patties are delicious for lunch or dinner.
In a medium sauce pan, cook rice in oil over medium heat for about 3 minutes. Pour in chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Stir in onion, green pepper, jalapeno, and diced tomato. Season with bouillon cube, salt and pepper, cumin, cilantro, and garlic. Bring to a boil, cover, and reduce heat to low. Cook for 20 minutes. This is an excellent authentic Mexican rice recipe (not to be confused with Spanish rice) that I make as a side dish with all of my Mexican dishes. The key is cooking the rice properly and using good quality chicken broth or stock.
In a glass or plastic bowl, whisk together the soy sauce, oil, lemon juice, sesame seeds, sugar, green onions, garlic, and ginger. Thread the meat onto skewers. (If you are using wooden skewers, soak them 30 minutes first.) Place the skewers in a plastic or glass container just large enough to hold them, and pour the marinade over the meat, turning to coat well. Cover, and chill for a minimum of 4 hours. Preheat grill for high heat, and position grate 5 inches from coals. Brush grate with oil, and place skewers on grill.  Grill for 10 to 15 minutes, occasionally turning kabobs to ensure even cooking. This marinade is delicious with beef, but is great with pork or chicken too. You will need to adjust the cooking time depending upon the meat or poultry you use for the skewers.
In a quart jar, combine all ingredients in layers, placing flour on bottom, then cinnamon in middle and other ingredients on top.  Place seal on jar. Store in a cool, dry place up to 6 months.

Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each pancake. Brown on both sides and serve hot. A lovely mix that can be placed in a jar to give as a gift.  A great change from cookies in a jar. Just copy the recipe onto a card and attach it to your jar to give as a gift.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Place a serving platter into the oven to warm. Season the chicken breast pieces with salt and pepper and dredge them in flour. Shake off excess flour. Heat the vegetable oil in a skillet; pan-fry the chicken pieces until golden brown on both sides, about 3 minutes per side. Work in batches and do not crowd skillet, adding oil as needed . Place the chicken pieces onto the warmed platter in the oven. When finished with all the chicken, drain most of the oil from the skillet, leaving a thin coating on the surface of the pan. Cook and stir the minced garlic in the skillet until fragrant, about 20 seconds. Pour in the chicken broth. Scrape and dissolve any brown bits from the bottom of the skillet. Stir in the lemon slices and bring the mixture to a boil. Let cook, stirring occasionally, until the sauce reduces to about 2/3 cup, 5 to 8 minutes. Add the lemon juice and capers; simmer until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 5 minutes more. Drop the butter into the skillet and swirl it into the sauce by tilting the skillet until the butter is melted and incorporated. Add the parsley; remove from heat and set aside. Arrange the chicken medallions on serving plates and spoon sauce over each portion to serve. This delicious chicken dish is exquisite and easy to prepare. The light and luscious lemon sauce really pops without being too acidic; it is simply divine. Serve it with herb-roasted potatoes or lemon-rice pilaf.
Heat oil in a large 2-inch deep skillet. Dip chicken in egg beat, then coat in bread crumbs. Brown in skillet on both sides. When chicken is browned, add broth and place asparagus evenly over chicken. Lay a slice of cheese over each chicken piece.

Covered with Provolone cheese and canned asparagus.
Place a heavy pot over high heat. Add the onion and bell pepper; cook 2 to 3 minutes without stirring until browned. Immediately pour in the chicken stock, and stir to release vegetables from the bottom of the pot. Reduce heat to low. Stir in the garlic, turkey, salsa, vegetable juice, hot pepper sauce, and lime juice. Simmer over medium heat until heated through, about 15 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. This is a great winter soup. Make it as spicy as you want. It's also a great way to get rid of leftover Thanksgiving turkey.
Place the eggplant slices in a bowl, and sprinkle with salt. Let drain over a bowl in the refrigerator for at least an hour. I like to do this overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook for about 6 minutes, or until almost tender. It will cook the rest of the way in the oven. Drain. Mix together the ricotta cheese and eggs in a small bowl. Stir in half of the mozzarella cheese and Pecorino Romano cheese. Spread a thin layer of sauce in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish. Arrange layers of eggplant, cheese, ziti pasta, and more sauce all the way to the top of the pan. Top with remaining mozzarella cheese. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until heated through and cheese is lightly browned. I come from a big Italian family, my mom made this all the time.  Very delicious and very hardy.  A great anytime meal. The secret to good eggplant is to peel and drain it, so it's not soggy.  Serve with crusty italian bread, and a tossed salad, and you have a hearty meal.  It seems like a lot of work but it's not.  I hope you enjoy your meal.
Place ingredients in the bread machine pan in the order suggested by the manufacturer. This Bread can be made with the White, Rapid, or Delay bake cycles.  Select one, and Start. This is a great snack bread made in the bread machine. Spread with jam or honey and serve as an after school treat.  You can use your favorite style of peanut butter with this one.  My favorite is extra crunchy.
Combine carrots, water, garlic, olive oil, paprika, cayenne pepper, salt, and black pepper in a shallow pan; bring to a boil over medium-high heat and cook until carrots are tender and water evaporates, about 20 minutes. Stir vinegar and cumin through the carrot mixture. Remove the pan from heat and set aside to allow salad to cool to room temperature. Garnish with cilantro to serve. Carrots are cut into thin, round pieces and cooked with the spices.
Place ham in slow cooker with the fattier side facing down. Use toothpicks to attach pineapple rings to the ham. Pour juice from the can over the ham. Pour the cola into the slow cooker. Cook on Low 7 to 10 hours. This ham was a big hit at an Easter party a few years back. I got the recipe and have been making it ever since! It's simple since it only has 3 ingredients, but it's delicious nonetheless! I prefer to leave my ham whole once it's done cooking, but others have said they like to shred the ham into chunks and mix the cooked pineapple with it.
In a food processor, combine the mayonnaise, chipotle chilies, and adobo sauce. Pulse until smooth and well blended. This recipe is super easy with a food processor!  Use this mayo on cold cut sandwiches or mixed with canned fish. Don't use Miracle Whip or salad dressing for this.  Neither one qualifies as mayonnaise and are not as thick as the real thing, which will make your result much runnier.  You can get the chipotle chiles in adobo sauce at a supermarket with a good variety of more authentic Mexican items.  They are either canned or bottled.
In a blender, combine banana, peanut butter and soy milk. Blend until smooth. Pour into glasses and drizzle with honey for garnish. Like a peanut butter and banana sandwich in liquid form.  Makes a nice thick breakfast smoothie.
Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Saute onion and jalapeno in hot oil until just translucent and softening, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir pickled peppers and 1/4 cup reserved pickling liquid into onion mixture; cook and stir until liquid reduces and flavors blend, 3 to 5 minutes. Season with salt. The whole trick here is to find Peppadew® peppers, which have a very vibrant, sweet-hot-tangy flavor, and quickly and easily turn a pan of sauteed onions and jalapenos into a world-class condiment.
In a bowl, stir together olive oil, wasabi powder, sesame seeds, and cracked black pepper. Toss tuna into mixture until evenly coated.

This tuna tar tar is just amazingly simple and outstanding!
Preheat a skillet over medium heat. Combine all ingredients in a blender. Puree until smooth. Pour batter onto the griddle, to form 5 pancakes. Flip pancakes when edges appear to harden. Cook pancakes on other side for same amount of time until golden brown. These are very delicious pancakes and my family loves them.
Toss the romaine lettuce, blueberries, dried cranberries, sunflower seeds, walnut pieces, feta cheese, and goat cheese in a large bowl. Pour the vinegar, syrup, and grapeseed oil over the salad one at a time; toss until evenly coated. Season with salt. My mom began making this salad a few years ago and, as soon as I tried it, I just had to get the recipe. This is my version, but can be varied in many different ways because it's all about the dressing! So simple, yet so delicious that you are sure to get requests for the recipe whenever you make it! You can use pecans, almonds, or pine nuts in place of the walnuts.
In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Stir in the vanilla and oats. Next, combine the flour, baking soda and salt; stir into the creamed mixture. Divide the dough into 3 sections, and shape each section into a log about 8 inches long. Roll each log in the sprinkles to coat, then wrap them in waxed paper and chill overnight.

Dip a 2 inch diameter biscuit cutter into some flour, and cut out 8 to 10 rounds.  Place rounds about 2 inches apart on prepared baking sheet. Use up remaining dough by patting it into a smaller disk and cutting again. Bake in preheated oven until risen and golden brown, about 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature. This is probably one of the best scone recipes I've made. The texture is nice and the taste is excellent. They have just a hint of eggnog, so even those who aren't big fans of the drink will like them.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Prepare Cream Cheese Frosting (see footnote for link to recipe). In a medium bowl, cream butter and brown sugar until light and fluffy.  Stir in the egg yolk, then stir in the flour until combined. Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and dip in egg white. Place 1 inch apart on the cookie sheet. Make an indentation in each cookie with your finger or the end of a wooden spoon. Bake in the preheated oven for 8 minutes; remove from oven and fill indentations with Cream Cheese Frosting. Return cookies to the oven for another 3 to 5 minutes, or until golden brown. Let cool for 1 to 2 minutes before removing from pan. A delightful thumbprint cookie.  Delicious cream cheese filling.
In a large bowl, mix garlic, onion, soy sauce, corn syrup, apple juice, Worcestershire sauce, molasses, wine, Italian-style salad dressing, distilled white vinegar, garlic powder, salt, onion powder, Cajun seasoning, crushed red pepper, seasoning salt and brown sugar. Score pork shoulder 1/8 to 1/4 inch deep. Place in the bowl with the marinade mixture. Marinate at least 4 hours in the refrigerator. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium high heat and lightly oil grate. Cook marinated pork shoulder on the prepared grill 3 hours, or until the internal temperature has reach a minimum of 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Marinate frequently with the mixture while grilling. This tangy marinade for grilled pork shoulder is swimming with spices. You'll really taste the garlic!
In a large pot over medium-low heat, combine tomatoes, tomato paste, carrot, onion, celery, wine, pepper flakes, bell peppers and steak sauce. While tomato mixture is simmering, in a large skillet over medium heat, cook bacon until crisp.  Remove to paper towels.  Cook beef in bacon drippings until brown; drain.  Stir chili seasoning into ground beef. Stir seasoned beef, cumin and bacon into tomato mixture.  Continue to simmer until vegetables are tender and flavors are well blended.

Select 'Mix Bread' cycle or the setting that allows ingredients such as seeds or fruit to be folded into the dough; press Start. Add the chocolate chips at the signal, or about 5 minutes before the kneading cycle has finished. Remove loaf from pan to cool when bake cycle finishes. This is a different kind of bread that the entire family can enjoy anytime of the day. It has plenty of chocolate chips and just a hint of cinnamon.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat 3 tablespoons of olive oil over medium heat in an oven-safe skillet, and cook and stir the onion and garlic until translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the green peppers, and cook and stir until they have begun to soften, 5 more minutes. Pour the eggs over the vegetables, and stir in the basil, rosemary, salt, and pepper. Reduce the heat to medium-low, let the eggs sit over the heat until they have started to set, about 10 minutes. Transfer the skillet to the preheated oven and cook the frittata until fully set, about 15 minutes. While the frittata is baking, heat 1 cup of olive oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Deep-fry the sweet potato slices, a layer at a time, until golden brown and crisp, about 5 minutes. Remove with a slotted spoon, and drain on paper towels. Top baked frittata with the fried sweet potato slices to serve. Rosemary and basil egg frittata, topped with sweet potato sticks.
In one medium bowl, mix together 3 cups of flour, garlic salt, 1 tablespoon black pepper, paprika and poultry seasoning. In a separate bowl, stir together 1 1/3 cups flour, salt, 1/4 teaspoon pepper, egg yolks and beer. You may need to thin with additional beer if the batter is too thick. Heat the oil in a deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Moisten each piece of chicken with a little water, then dip in the dry mix. Shake off excess and dip in the wet mix, then dip in the dry mix once more. Carefully place the chicken pieces in the hot oil. Fry for 15 to 18 minutes, or until well browned. Smaller pieces will not take as long. Large pieces may take longer. Remove and drain on paper towels before serving. This is the crispiest, spiciest, homemade fried chicken I have ever tasted! It is equally good served hot or cold and has been a picnic favorite in my family for years.
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Set an oven rack to the second-lowest level in the oven. Fill a bowl with lightly salted water. Place Brussels sprouts in salted water and let sit for about 15 minutes; drain. Stir potatoes, carrots, cauliflower, beets, shallot, olive oil, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Pour vegetables in a single layer onto a baking sheet. Roast in the preheated oven until caramelized and cooked through, about 45 minutes. Roasted vegetables are one of my absolute favorite side dishes, especially in the winter. They take a while to cook, but overall are an extremely easy dish to prepare. I've found that the key is to place them low in the oven so that you get a good caramelized side. Don't move or flip them, but keep an eye on them so that you don't go past 'caramelized' to 'burned.'
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease muffin cups or line with paper muffin liners. In a large bowl, combine flour, baking powder, baking soda, salt, basil,  oregano and sugar into large bowl; stir until well blended.  Mix in tomatoes, 1.5 cups of cheese and onions.  In another bowl beat egg, whisk in buttermilk and stir until combined.  Spoon batter into muffin tins until half full.  Sprinkle remaining 1 cup cheese on top of muffins. Bake in preheated oven for 15 to 20 minutes, until a toothpick inserted into center of the muffin comes out clean. Great muffin for lunches, with a pasta dish or a late night snack.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper or a silicone liner. Whisk together the flour, cinnamon, ginger, cloves, baking soda, and salt in a bowl until thoroughly combined. In a large bowl, mash vegetable shortening and sugar together until smooth and creamy; mix in the egg and molasses. Stir the flour mixture into the molasses mixture to make a smooth dough, and mix in the chocolate chips. Drop by scant tablespoon or small dough scoop about 2 inches apart onto the prepared baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until slightly golden brown, 10 to 12 minutes. Allow to cool on sheets 1 to 2 minutes before removing to finish cooling on wire racks. This delicious twist on chocolate chip cookies leaves the house smelling of cinnamon and spice, and the chocolate chips make everything nice. Fantastic with a glass of milk.
Blend strawberries and lemon juice together in a blender until smooth; refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Stir yogurt and sugar into strawberry mixture until well blended and smooth; pour mixture into ice cream machine's container. Freeze according to manufacturer's directions for a soft-serve consistency. Imagine the most delicious strawberry ice cream made from just 4 basic ingredients: Greek yogurt, strawberries, sugar, and a squeeze of lemon. This recipe may be made from yogurt, but it is as creamy as ice cream (and better for you so you can eat as much as you want!)
In a 2-quart container, stir honey and triple sec together until honey has dissolved. Mix in the orange juice, lemon juice, and lime juice, brandy, Cabernet Sauvignon wine, and sparkling water. Stir in the orange, lemon, and lime slices; adjust sweetness with more honey, if necessary, and serve in tall glasses over ice. My husband, Randy, has perfected traditional sangria. I shared this tasty and potent summer cooler with my AR friends at MauiGirl's home, ergo, the title of the recipe. I hope that you enjoy it too. Be careful. This sangria can 'sneak up' on you!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake pie crusts following package directions, but cutting the bake time in half. In a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef until evenly brown; drain excess fat. Place half the refried beans in each pie shell, smearing over the bottom and the sides of the partially baked shells. Spread a layer of ground meat over the beans, and top with the onion, crushed tortilla chips, and cheese. Bake 15 to 20 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown, and the cheese is bubbly. Top with lettuce, tomato, sour cream, and black olives. This is an easy, quick recipe using hamburger.
Combine turkey carcass, water, 1 cup celery, 2 carrots, onion, 2 teaspoons salt, thyme, bouillon, and bay leaf in large 4 quart stockpot.  Bring to boiling.  Lower heat, and cover.  Simmer for 1 1/2 hours.  Strain stock, and discard solids.  Skim off fat using ladle or fat separator.  Pick meat off bones when cooled.  Reserve meat. Combine 6 tablespoons flour and 1/2 cup milk in a jar with a tight fitting lid.  Shake to combine.  Pour stock into pot.  Bring to simmering.  Strain flour mixture through sieve into stock, stirring. Slice remaining 3 carrots.  Add rutabaga, ground pepper, remaining 1/2 cup celery, and sliced carrots.  Simmer 20 minutes, or until vegetables are tender. While the soup is simmering, prepare the dumplings.  Combine parsley and bread in processor; whirl until medium size crumbs.  Add 1 1/4 cups flour, baking powder, and salt; process just until combined.  Add 1/2 cup milk and butter; process using on-off pulses just until blended. Drop mounded tablespoons of dumpling mixture into simmering soup. Place cover on pot.  Cook for 12 minutes, or until dumplings are dry in center.  Add turkey meat; cook 3 minutes, or until heated through. This is a yummy variation of that traditional use of the leftover turkey.
Place the mango pieces and sugar into a blender. Puree until smooth. Add the lime and orange zest and juices along with the tangerine juice. Puree until evenly blended. Pour into a container, and refrigerate at least 1 hour, preferably overnight. Pour the chilled mixture into an ice cream maker and freeze according to manufacturer's directions until it reaches "soft-serve" consistency. Transfer ice cream to a one- or two-quart lidded plastic container; cover surface with plastic wrap and seal. For best results, sorbet should ripen in the freezer for at least 2 hours or overnight. This is a recipe adapted from my Cuisinart® ice cream/yogurt maker booklet. We love the smooth creamy texture even after storing it in the freezer. Our favorite blend of juices is lime and mango. We like to keep it low cal by substituting in no calorie sweetener. This is an especially refreshing dessert on our hot southern summer evenings. I fix it inside while my husband is outside grilling.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13-inch baking pan. Whisk flour, baking powder, and salt together in a bowl. Beat brown sugar, butter, eggs, and 1 tablespoon vanilla extract together in a bowl using an electric mixer until smooth and creamy. Stir flour mixture into creamed butter mixture until batter is well combined and thick; spread into the prepared baking pan. Combine white sugar, 2 tablespoons cinnamon, and ginger together in a bowl; sprinkle over batter. Bake in the preheated oven until blondies are beginning to pull away from the sides of the pan and are set in the middle, 25 to 30 minutes. Allow blondies to cool, at least 30 minutes. Beat confectioners' sugar, cream,  1 tablespoon cinnamon, and 1 teaspoon vanilla extract together in a bowl until glaze is smooth; drizzle onto blondies. Super easy. Great snickerdoodle taste with no fuss!
Heat oven to 425 degrees F. In small bowl, stir together Topping ingredients; set aside. In medium bowl, stir Biscuit ingredients until soft dough forms. Drop dough by 8 spoonfuls onto ungreased cookie sheet. Bake 16 to 18 minutes or until biscuits are golden brown. Immediately brush hot biscuits with Topping. Serve warm. Buttery and tender, these biscuits are just like your favorite restaurant treat.
Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook pasta according to package directions; add broccoli to pasta 2 minutes before draining. Meanwhile in a large skillet heat the sauce; drain the pasta/broccoli and combine with sauce. Drizzle with extra virgin olive oil and top with cheese before serving. With the addition of broccoli florets, this spaghetti with pasta sauce is a complete one-dish meal.
In a small bowl, dissolve yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in honey and 3/4 cup flour. Whisk until smooth. Cover bowl and let stand for 1 1/2 hours. In a large bowl, combine butter pieces with remaining cup flour. Pour in yeast batter and stir to moisten. Turn dough onto lightly floured surface, pat dough down and roll into a rectangle. Fold 1/3 of dough toward center then fold other side of dough over first 1/3. Lift dough and scrape work surface clean. Sprinkle area with flour and repeat; rolling and folding 3 more times. Dough must be hard; if not, freeze for 45 minutes. Pat dough into rectangle.  Cut into 3 parts, 1 part for each 4 croissants. Work with one piece at a time, holding others in refrigerator until ready to use. Roll each piece individually into 1/4 inch thick rectangles. Cut into two  pieces. Cut each piece crosswise diagonally to form 4 triangles. Roll from wide end to point and curve ends to form a crescent shape. Place on ungreased cookie sheets. In a small bowl, beat together egg and water. Brush croissants with egg wash and set aside to rise for 1 hour. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Glaze croissants with the egg mixture once more before baking. Bake in preheated oven until puffed and brown, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly and serve. Light and tender croissants with the hearty taste of whole wheat. Make sure that you use whole wheat pastry flour not whole wheat bread flour.

Stir together flour and water until dissolved. Pour into the boiling sauce and stir until thickened. Season to taste with salt if needed. Add the clams in their shells, and toss until coated with sauce. Sprinkle with chopped parsley to serve. This is a very common recipe here in Spain. I give you my mom's Galician variation, you will love it!
Line a medium sized, round colander with a cheese cloth or a clean dish towel. Place the crumbled tofu in the colander. Place another cheese cloth over the top of the tofu. Place the colander over the top of a bowl to catch the liquid. Place a heavy weight on top of tofu. Refrigerate the colander, tofu and weight for 2 to 3 hours. Make the stuffing: In a large frying pan saute onion, celery and mushrooms in 2 tablespoons of the sesame oil until tender. Add the garlic, sage, thyme, salt and pepper, rosemary and 1/4 cup of the tamari. Stir well; cook for 5 minutes. Add prepared herb stuffing and mix well. Remove from heat. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a cookie sheet. Combine 1/2 cup sesame oil, 1/4 cup tamari, miso, orange juice, mustard and orange zest in a small bowl; mix well. Remove the weight from the tofu. Hollow out the tofu so that there is one inch of tofu still lining the colander. Place the scooped out tofu in a separate bowl. Brush the tofu lining with a small amount of the miso seasoning. Scoop the stuffing into the center of the tofu shell. Place the leftover tofu on top of the stuffing and press down firmly. Turn the stuffed tofu onto the prepared cookie sheet. Putting the leftover tofu side of the "turkey" (the flat side) down. Gently press on the sides of the "turkey" to form a more oval shape.

Adjust levels of salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper if needed. Serve in bowls; sprinkle with Parmesan cheese. This simple squash and sausage stew represents my idea of the perfect summer supper. It's very comforting, relatively fast, wonderfully flavorful, and helps solve a problem that's existed since neighbors started planting gardens: what to do with all that squash! Serve it with a big slice of crusty bread for dipping into the broth.
Blend together the cream cheese and cream until light and fluffy. Sift the sugar, and add to the cream cheese blend. This frosting is good for many types of cakes including carrot cakes, apple cakes, and spice cakes.  Add flavorings to compliment the cake you are frosting.  Try 1 1/2 teaspoons of grated lemon or orange rind, 1 teaspoon any extract, 1 teaspoon of liqueur, or a mashed banana.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line an 8-inch square baking dish with aluminum foil or baking parchment. Grease the lining. Mix rice flour, quinoa flakes, tapioca starch, coconut, baking powder, stevia powder, and salt together in a large bowl; add coconut oil and mix. Beat egg and agave nectar together; add to the flour mixture and mix into a dough. Spread dough into the prepared baking dish and flatten into an even layer. Spread jam to cover nearly to the edges of the dough. Bake in preheated oven until the edges are browned and the jam is bubbling, 20 to 25 minutes. Cool bars for 10 minutes in the dish before lifting from pan by aluminum foil or parchment paper; cut into 9 squares. The crust is similar to a whole-grain shortbread cookie. Sweet and slightly sticky, this bar cookie will satisfy any sweet tooth!

Toss together well and season with salt and pepper to taste. This is a delicious potato salad that includes sausage, olives and many other zesty flavors.  It's great to serve at a summer picnic lunch or barbecue.
Place bacon in a large skillet or wok; cook and stir just until crispy, about 10 minutes. Add mushrooms and cook until mushrooms are tender, about 5 minutes. Stir water and curry sauce mix into bacon-mushroom mixture; bring to a boil. Cook, stirring occasionally, until sauce is thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Season chicken breasts with salt and black pepper. Whisk panko bread crumbs, salt, black pepper, and cayenne pepper together in a pie plate or shallow bowl. Pour beaten eggs into a second shallow bowl. Dip chicken in the beaten eggs and coat with bread crumbs mixture. Heat peanut oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Cook chicken in the hot oil until no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes per side. Slice chicken. Spoon 1/2 cup rice onto individual plates; top with chicken, curry sauce, and 1 slice Havarti cheese. This is Coco-style chicken curry. Mozzarella cheese can be substituted for Havarti if desired.
Melt coconut oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Saute chicken in hot oil until browned completely, about 5 minutes; add celery, onion, curry powder, and garlic and continue to saute until the onion is tender, 8 to 10 minutes more. Pour chicken broth, water, and coconut milk into the pot; add butternut squash, diced tomatoes with green chile peppers, and coconut. Bring the liquid to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook the soup at a simmer until the squash is soft, about 40 minutes.

I serve it with biscuits or naan bread, depending on whether we are feeling cultured or down-home!
Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. Mix cookie crumbs and cream cheese together in a bowl; roll into balls and arrange on the prepared baking sheet. Freeze cookie balls until solid, about 1 hour. Melt almond bark in the top of a double boiler over simmering water, stirring frequently and scraping down the sides with a rubber spatula to avoid scorching. Dip cookie balls in the melted almond bark, removing balls using 2 forks to allow excess bark drip back into double boiler. Arrange coated cookie balls on the baking sheet; refrigerate until coating is firm, about 10 minutes. This is a major hit at my house! Made them for Christmas and also for my mother on Mother's Day! Hint: when mixing Oreos® and cream cheese, do it with your clean hands! Store remaining Oreo® balls in a covered container in the refrigerator.
In large mixing bowl, blend ice cream, Irish cream, coffee liqueur and chocolate syrup.  Be careful not to liquefy it, some ice cream lumps give it character.

Place the potatoes in a large pot and fill with enough water to cover them. Bring to a boil and cook until tender enough to pierce with a fork. Drain and cool slightly, then remove the peels, and slice into 1/4 inch thick slices. Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a 9x9 inch baking dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add macaroni and cook until barely tender, about 6 minutes. Drain and set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion; cook and stir until onion starts to turn translucent. Stir in the garlic, and cook for a few more minutes. Remove from the heat and set aside. Layer the macaroni, onions and potatoes into the prepared baking dish. Season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle the shredded Gruyere cheese over the top, and drizzle cream evenly over the entire dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top is golden brown, 15 to 20 minutes. This is a traditional Swiss dish served on the slopes of the Alps. I like to top it with chunky apple sauce and crunchy onions to serve.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a roasting pan (large enough to accommodate 8 pepper halves in a single layer) with cooking spray. Combine the ground sirloin, Italian sausage, brown rice, Italian seasonings, salt, pepper, garlic, Parmesan cheese, egg, and 1/2 cup Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce in a large bowl. Mix until combined. Divide meat mixture evenly among the green pepper halves; press to compress slightly. Arrange halves in prepared pan. Spoon the remaining Classico(R) Tomato & Basil sauce onto the tops of the meat and peppers.  Cover tightly with foil. Bake until the peppers are soft and internal temperature of the meat reaches 165 degrees F, about 1 1/2 hours. Remove from oven. Remove foil and top each pepper with shredded cheese. Turn oven to broil. Place peppers, uncovered under the broiler. Broil until the cheese is melted and bubbly, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley. Stuffed peppers take on an Italian feel with the help of Classico® Fresh Tomato & Basil Sauce, Italian sausage, Parmesan cheese, and Italian seasonings.  It's comfort food kicked up a notch--and gluten free!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet to medium heat and fry bacon until crisp. Drain and pat dry with paper towels; set aside. In the same skillet, saute onion in bacon fat until tender. Add to bacon and set aside. In a separate large skillet, heat oil over medium high heat and brown chicken breasts. Place browned chicken in a lightly greased 9x13 inch baking dish; pour stir-fry sauce over chicken, then spoon salad dressing onto each breast. Sprinkle with cheese, and top with the bacon mixture. Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes or until chicken is cooked through and juices run clear. Chicken breasts browned and baked with soy, Parmesan cheese and a bacon/onion mixture. Simply delicious!
Place mango, banana, and ice cream into a blender, and sprinkle with white sugar, cinnamon, and nutmeg. Pour in milk and place the lid on the blender. Blend until smooth, then pour into cups to serve. This mango milkshake with banana is great! Add vanilla bean ice cream if you want this to be a really rich drink. If you add too much vanilla ice cream it will start to taste like a vanilla milk shake instead of a mango drink.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour two 8x4 inch loaf pans. Sift together the flour, baking powder and baking soda, set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter, white sugar, confectioners sugar and brown sugar until smooth. Add egg whites and egg yolks, beating after each addition. Stir in the vanilla. Stir in the dry ingredients alternately with the milk. Divide the batter evenly between the two pans. Bake for 60 to 70 minutes in the preheated oven, until a toothpick inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Cool in the pan for 10 minutes before inverting onto a wire rack to cool completely. This is my own recipe for pound cake. In this recipe, I use three different kinds of sugar and a lot of vanilla extract. It tastes good fresh and hot and also is good the day after.
Sift the confectioners' sugar into a small bowl.  Stir in enough milk to make a smooth but not too runny consistency.  You may need to adjust with some more sugar.  Divide this mixture into small containers, depending on how many colors you want.  Color each small container with colors appropriate for the season, using as much food coloring as needed to create desired hues. This is the recipe my mother uses to frost gingerbread cookies at Christmas.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain. In a large saucepan, melt butter and add white wine.

Bake 1 hour in the preheated oven, or until top is golden brown. Sprinkle lightly with confectioners' sugar before serving. A carrot souffle as good as your favorite restaurant makes!
Stir the yogurt, cucumber, chile pepper, cilantro, and salt together in a bowl until evenly mixed. Set aside in refrigerator to allow the flavors to mix for 10 minutes before serving cold. Quick and tasty Indian yogurt side dish that can help cool down any spicy meal. You can also add other veggies like onion, tomatoes, or bell peppers. I ate this almost every day growing up. The leftover cucumber seeds also taste great marinated in a little lemon juice with salt and pepper!
Place cream cheese and pesto in a food processor or blender. Blend until smooth. Mix in the chives and cilantro. Continue blending until smooth. Transfer to a mold lined with plastic wrap. Cover and chill in the refrigerator 1 hour, or until firm. This is a yummy, creamy version of standard pesto that makes a great spread for get togethers. Tastes great with pita chips or sourdough bread! Sun dried tomatoes may be mixed in for a zesty tang. Add crunch by coating the finished spread with almonds.
Combine chicken, 1/4 cup olive oil, 1/2 juiced lemon, chopped fresh rosemary, and garlic in a bowl; marinate chicken in refrigerator, at least 30 minutes. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat.

Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook the bow-tie pasta at a boil, stirring occasionally, until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes; drain. Mix pasta and sauce in with chicken and vegetables; stir until evenly combined. In Italian, giardino means garden. This Italian-inspired dish is loaded with fresh garden veggies and tossed in a delicious white wine and herb sauce.  It's light and satisfying, and it tastes just like a meal that used to be served at a popular restaurant chain. This feeds a crowd too!
Place the tomatoes in a large pot and squash them with your hands. Add the beans, onion, banana chile pepper, sugar, garlic powder and chili powder and simmer for about 20 minutes. Meanwhile, in a separate large skillet over medium high heat, saute the ground beef for 5 to 10 minutes, or until browned and crumbly. Drain the fat and add the beef to the simmering pot. Stir in the cheese, if desired. Allow to simmer for 1 more hour. Great tasting chili that doesn't take all day, but tastes like it did. Preparation time is about 2 hours. Best served over johnny cakes or corn chips.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Bring water to a boil in a saucepan and stir in yellow rice mix and olive oil; boil for 1 minute. Cover, reduce heat to low, and simmer until rice is tender and water has been absorbed, about 25 minutes. Spoon 3 tablespoons yellow rice into the bottom of each pepper. Cover rice with layers of refried beans, corn, and black olives, filling peppers almost to the top. Spoon salsa into peppers. Stand stuffed peppers upright in a baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until peppers are tender and filling is hot, about 30 minutes. Divide Mexican cheese blend over the peppers, return to oven, and bake until cheese has melted, about 5 more minutes. I'm not a big fan of traditional stuffed peppers, so I make mine Mexican-style! This dish was inspired by the Mexican seven-layer dip. I love to make them on Halloween and carve them to look like jack-o'-lanterns. Serve topped with sour cream and guacamole.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Wrap the tortillas in aluminum foil and heat in the oven. Combine the chicken, bell pepper, jerk seasoning, and pepper in a large bowl, set aside. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat, and coat with cooking spray. Add the pineapple and cook until brown, about 4 to 6 minutes. Remove the pineapple from the pan and set aside. Return the skillet to the stove and heat the vegetable oil. Add the chicken and peppers; cook and stir until the chicken is no longer pink, about 6 minutes. Stir in the cooked pineapple. Serve in the warmed tortillas and garnish with cilantro and a squeeze of lime. Pineapple brings a sweet and sassy flavor to this chicken fajita dish, we love it, have it a lot in the summer.
Heat oil in a deep-fryer or large saucepan to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fry chicken strips in the hot oil until warmed through, 2 to 3 minutes. Transfer chicken to paper towel-lined plates using a slotted spoon. Cut chicken into bite-size chunks. Layer mashed potatoes, Cheddar cheese, corn, and chicken, respectively, into individual serving bowls. Quick and easy comfort meal with chicken, mashed potatoes, corn, and cheese.

Set the sauce aside.  Place the pork chops on the prepared baking sheet. Bake the pork chops in the preheated oven until the juices start to run clear and an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a chop reads 120 degrees F (49 degrees C.) Transfer the pork chops to a baking dish big enough to lay the chops into the dish without overlapping. Pour the sauce over the chops, and cover the dish with foil. Bake the chops until no longer pink in the center, about 25 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). A sweet simmering sauce that works great with pork chops, chicken, etc.  Makes everything super tender. My kids love it!
Place  pork chops, soy sauce, ginger, garlic, and black pepper into a large, resealable, plastic bag.  Shake the bag gently to combine everything, and refrigerate for at least 2 hours.  These are excellent  done in the morning, and left to sit all day. Heat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a shallow dish, combine bread crumbs and sesame seeds.   Remove chops from marinade, making sure there are no ginger slices clinging to the meat, and lay them in the crumb mixture to coat.  If you like, place pieces of garlic from the marinade on the chops.  Place chops on a rack or baking sheet. Bake for approximately 45 minutes, or until done Marinated for 2 hours these chops are very good, marinated all day they are exquisite.  These can be done wonderfully on the bbq...just omit the crumb coating.  Enjoy!
Place the blanched almonds in the container of a food processor or blender. Process until finely ground, but do not make almond butter. Transfer the almonds to a medium bowl, and mix with egg whites, confectioners' sugar, and almond extract. Knead until the dough is smooth and uniform. If you have a stand mixer, use the dough hook attachment to mix. Divide into pieces and color as desired to make fruits, or whatever you desire. This Marzipan is a German specialty from the region of Lubeck, although it's believed to have Byzantine origins. This is great for making petit fours, filling chocolates and covering cakes.

Roll dough into 1 inch balls, and place them 2 inches apart on an ungreased cookie sheet. Bake for 12 minutes in the preheated oven. When cool, roll in remaining confectioners' sugar. I also like to roll mine in the sugar a second time. This is a family recipe that's been made at Christmas time by at least 4 generations. This year will be the first for number 5!!! 'Bubba' brought it with her when she came from Lithuania. I pass it on in the true spirit of this season!
Place the chicken into a large soup pot, and pour in the water. Add salt and 2 tablespoons butter, bring to a boil, and reduce heat to medium-low. Simmer the chicken until the meat is very tender, 2 1/2 to 3 hours. Remove the chicken from the stock, and allow the chicken and stock to cool. Separate the chicken meat from the skin and bones, and chop the meat into bite-size pieces. Strain chicken stock through a wire mesh strainer into a large pot; set aside. Bring all but 2/3 cup of the reserved chicken stock to a boil over medium heat. In a separate saucepan, bring 2/3 cup of chicken stock to a boil. Stir in 1/2 teaspoon salt and 4 teaspoons of butter, and bring the mixture to a boil over medium heat. Beat in the flour to form a slightly sticky dough. Remove dough to a well-floured surface, and roll to desired thickness. Knead in more flour if dough is too sticky. Cut the dough into strips about 4 inches long; drop dumplings into the boiling chicken stock. Reduce heat to low, and simmer the dumplings until tender, about 10 minutes. Stir 1 more tablespoon of butter into the stock to add richness, if desired; return chopped chicken meat to the pan. Stir in evaporated milk; simmer until chicken meat is hot. This is my mom's recipe for classic chicken and dumplings.  It is simple, hearty, and delicious!  I often do the chicken in the slow cooker, and do the rest on the stove when I get home from work.  I can have this on the table in 30 minutes using this method.  Also, if you really love dumplings, you might want to double the recipe.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Prick the sweet potatoes with a fork and bake in the preheated oven 1 hour, or until tender. Peel the baked sweet potatoes.

Mix the pear puree, cinnamon, nutmeg, orange juice and pecans into the sweet potato mixture. Transfer to a large baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven 15 minutes, or until lightly browned. These creamy sweet potatoes baked with pears smell wonderful while cooking and taste magnificent on the Thanksgiving table. This dish is sure to become a family favorite!
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease two 9-inch round cake pans with butter. Line the bottoms with parchment paper, then grease the parchment paper. Sift together the cake flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt in a bowl. Beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer in a large bowl until light and fluffy. The mixture should be noticeably lighter in color. Add the room-temperature eggs one at a time, allowing each egg to blend into the butter mixture before adding the next. Beat in the vanilla with the last egg.  Pour in the flour mixture alternately with the buttermilk, mixing until just incorporated. Pour the batter into the prepared pans. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, 35 to 40 minutes. Cool in the pans for 10 minutes, then run a paring knife between the cake and the edge of the pan. Hold the cake pan on its side and gently tap the sides of the pan against the counter to loosen it. Cover the cake pan with a plate or cooling rack, and invert it to tip the cake out of the pan and onto the plate. I call it the Clooney cake because it is oh so super moist.  It is the best yellow cake recipe since the dawn of time. I really hope you like it!
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the linguine, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 11 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Transfer the linguine to a large mixing bowl. Heat the olive oil and butter together in large skillet over medium heat until the butter is melted. Cook and stir the garlic in the butter and oil for 2 to 3 minutes. Add shrimp and cook for 4 to 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Stir in the wine, lemon juice, red pepper, basil, and salt and cook another 1 minute. Mix in the tomatoes and cook 1 minute more; remove from heat and transfer mixture to the bowl with the linguine. Sprinkle the Pecorino Romano cheese and parsley over the pasta and sauce; toss until well mixed. This recipe results in lots of garlicky shrimp with some white wine and lemon juice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place a baking rack over a roasting pan. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet, and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until browned but not totally crisp, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate. Mix the flour, salt, and black pepper into a resealable plastic bag, seal the bag, and shake a few times to combine. Beat the eggs with water in a shallow dish. Place the corn bread stuffing mix into a large plastic bag, seal the bag, and roll the stuffing with a rolling pin to crush it into crumbs. Pour the stuffing crumbs into a shallow dish. Mix in the Parmesan cheese. Rinse chicken breasts, shake off excess water, and place them, one at a time, into the bag containing the flour. Seal the bag and shake well to coat the chicken with flour; shake off excess flour. Dip the floured breast into the beaten egg, then gently but firmly press into the corn stuffing crumbs, turning to coat all sides. Heat canola oil in a large skillet over medium heat, and pan fry the breaded chicken breasts until golden brown, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer the chicken breasts to the baking rack; cut the bacon slices in half crosswise, and lay 4 halves on each chicken breast. Top the bacon with a slice of American cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the chicken is cooked through and no longer pink inside, the bacon is crisp, and the cheese has melted, 15 to 20 minutes. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a breast should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C). I have been making this dish since I was in my early teen years. Instead of using regular bread crumbs, I use a packaged cornbread stuffing to make a more crispy/crunchy coating. The Parmesan cheese  may be increased or decreased depending on your personal taste.  Try switching out the American cheese.  I have made this with Swiss cheese and served sauteed mushrooms and onions to put over the top. I usually serve with steamed broccoli and roasted potatoes.
In a large bowl combine the chicken, lettuce, green bell pepper, tomatoes and onions. Mix together and set aside. Heat tortillas by placing them in a large dry skillet over medium high heat and turning once until golden and puffy. To Assemble Tostadas: Place a tortilla on a plate, top with some of the chicken mixture and garnish with sour cream, salsa and cheese. Repeat with all tortillas. Golden tortillas filled with a mixture of chicken, lettuce, tomatoes and bell pepper, then garnished with sour cream, salsa and cheese for a real taste of Mexico. This recipe is from The WEBB Cooks, articles and recipes by Robyn Webb, courtesy of the American Diabetes Association. Preparation time: 15 minutes.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 5x8-inch baking dish. Place sweet potato into a large pot and cover with water; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until tender, about 20 minutes. Drain and mash sweet potato until smooth. Sift flour, white sugar, and baking powder together in a large bowl. Whisk eggs and vanilla extract together in another large bowl. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat; cook and stir pumpkin seeds and brown sugar in hot butter until brown sugar is melted, 1 to 2 minutes. Stir bananas and mashed sweet potato into pumpkin seed mixture. Remove from heat and cool slightly. Stir banana mixture into egg mixture until well-combined. Pour banana-egg mixture into flour mixture and stir until batter is just combined; stir in raisins. Pour into prepared baking dish. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center of the cake comes out clean, about 1 hour. Sweet bananas and sweet potatoes make up this moist cake. I add candied pumpkin seeds and vanilla.
Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat and stir in the Italian sausage. Cook and stir until crumbly, evenly browned, and no longer pink. Drain and discard any excess grease, then remove the sausage from the skillet and place into a bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the skillet. Stir in the onion, green bell pepper, and red bell pepper; cook and stir until the onion is golden, and the peppers are tender, about 8 minutes. Stir in the garlic and mushrooms; cook for 1 minute more. Season with parsley, garlic powder, oregano, basil, and red pepper flakes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Stir to combine, then scrape the vegetables into the bowl with the sausage. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Place the pierogies into the hot oil, and cook until golden brown on each side and hot in the center, about 5 minutes. Spoon the sausage and vegetable mixture over the pierogies. Sprinkle with mozzarella cheese and Romano cheese. Cover, and cook until the cheese has melted. Sausage, onions, peppers and mushrooms turn frozen pierogies into a delicious treat. This simple meal takes only 45 minutes to prepare. This recipe is so versatile.  Try experimenting with different sausages, vegetables and cheeses.
Preheat the oven's broiler and set the oven rack at about 6 inches from the heat source. Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Warm the olive oil and garlic in a small saucepan over low heat for 5 minutes to infuse the flavor of the garlic into the olive oil. Place the bread crumbs into a mixing bowl, and pour the oil mixture overtop. Stir the parsley, and Parmesan cheese into the bread crumb mixture until evenly blended. Press the venison cubes into the bread crumb mixture to coat, and place onto the prepared baking sheet. Make sure the venison pieces are not touching. Broil in the oven until the bread crumbs are golden, and the venison has turned from red to pink in the center, or to your desired degree of doneness, about 6 minutes. Turn the cubes occasionally as they cook. Divide the arugula onto 4 dinner plates, and top with the broiled venison. Squeeze a quarter of a lemon over each plate to serve. My husband loves venison, and I'm always trying to come up with creative things to do with it.  This is by far one of his favorite dishes.
Whisk together the water, whiskey, pineapple juice, brown sugar, diced onion, teriyaki sauce, soy sauce, liquid smoke, and minced garlic in a bowl. Lie the steaks in the bottom of a baking dish. Pour the marinade over the steaks; refrigerate overnight. Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat, and lightly oil grate. Grill steaks to desired doneness, 3 to 5 minutes per side for medium-rare. Allow steaks to rest for 5 to 10 minutes before serving. I love the steak at a restaurant I frequent. I developed a recipe at home through trial and error. I feel it comes pretty close. This is a flavorful way to grill steak. Hope you enjoy!
Combine chicken broth, water, chicken breast, kale, turnips, kohlrabi, spinach, celery, leek, carrots, garlic, and barley in a large pot; season with salt and pepper. Bring the soup to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and cook at a simmer until barley is cooked through but firm to the bite, about 1 hour. This is a soup recipe using some vegetables that were a little unknown to me.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat. Lightly oil grate, and set 4 inches from the heat. Place the bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium-high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels. Place hot dogs on grill; cook until browned, 5 to 8 minutes, turning once, or until done to suit your taste. Lightly grill hot dog buns. To assemble sandwiches, place a slice of cheese and bacon on each roll. Add a hot dog, top each with 1 tablespoon barbeque sauce, or desired amount, and red onion. My family has been eating hot dogs this way for years. They are so much better than your average hot dog!
Whisk together the rice vinegar, white sugar, sea salt, sesame oil, and olive oil in the bottom of a salad bowl. Add the asparagus, feta, tomato, green onion, and cilantro to the bowl with the dressing; toss to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 1 hour before serving. This is a fresh summer salad with a light dressing inspired by Mediterranean and Asian flavors.
Grate 2 teaspoons of zest from orange; discard remaining peel and pith from orange. Divide orange into sections. Place orange sections, orange zest, cranberries, sugar, and cinnamon in a food processor; pulse until finely chopped. Transfer relish to a bowl and cover; refrigerate to allow flavors to blend, at least 2 hours. A delightful change from the ordinary...the only relish most of my family will eat! Relish can be chilled up to 3 days.
In a medium bowl, mash the hard-cooked eggs with a fork or pastry blender.  Mix in mayonnaise, honey mustard, and jalapeno. Season with black pepper, garlic powder, and salt. Spread egg mixture on four of the bread slices.  Layer with baby spinach leaves and tomato slices, and top with remaining slices of bread. An egg salad sandwich with new twist!  Fresh tomatoes and baby spinach add beautiful color and great flavor.
Place raspberries in work bowl of a food processor, and process until smooth.  If an extra smooth sorbet is desired, press pureed raspberries through a fine sieve to remove seeds.  Whisk together pureed raspberries and honey in a large bowl. Combine 3 cups of water, sugar, and corn syrup in a large saucepan; stir to combine.  Bring to a boil over high heat.  Boil until sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes; do not stir.  Stir the sugar water and the remaining 1 cup of water into the raspberry puree. Make an ice bath by filling a very large bowl with water and ice.  Set the bowl of raspberry puree in the ice bath, and whisk until cool.  Pour cooled puree into a 9x13 baking dish, and cover; freeze until solid, 6 to 8 hours. To make a coarsely textured granita, use a fork to scrape frozen puree into small crumbs.  For a deliciously silky sorbet, transfer frozen puree to a food processor and process until smooth. No ice cream machine required!  Partially sweetened with honey to give it a delicious sun-ripened quality.  Very tart and very flavorful.  This recipe is versatile, as the finished product can be an icy granita or smooth sorbet. 
Heat the olive oil in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and onion; cook and stir until the onion has softened and turned translucent, about 5 minutes. Stir in the beef, and continue cooking until the beef is evenly browned. Season with salt and pepper. Add the chicken broth, water, lime juice, and jalapeno. Increase heat to medium-high, and bring to a boil. Stir in bok choy, and simmer until tender, about 5 minutes. Mix in chile-garlic sauce. A spicy-warm soup with light flavorings. As is, I believe it is mildly hot, depending on the jalapenos' quality. Consider adding chayote, more lime, beef broth, tomatoes, or hotter peppers. Very versatile recipe. I recommend serving this soup over or with rice.
Arrange eggplant slices on a large plate and sprinkle both sides with salt. Refrigerate until water has been drawn out, at least 30 minutes. Rinse eggplant slices and pat dry with a paper towel. Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Lightly brush both sides of eggplant slices with olive oil and season with Italian seasoning. Grill eggplant slices on the preheated grill, exactly 3 minutes per side. Spread goat cheese on 1 side of each eggplant slice and sprinkle with roasted red peppers. Serve open-faced or rolled up. Tasty grilled eggplant complements the flavors of goat cheese and roasted red pepper in this 'couldn't be easier' recipe that is good served hot, cold, or as leftovers. To re-warm, place on low-heat grill for 2 minutes.

Stir flour mixture into creamed mixture alternately with yogurt, stirring until just combined. Fold in pecans and pour batter into prepared tube pan. Bake in preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool 10 minutes in pan before removing to a wire rack to cool completely. Dust with confectioner's sugar before serving. This cake was created for Reds Espresso Gallery of San Diego, in the Maui test Kitchen on Puunoa! It was first made with bananas from the back yard...yummy!
In a small bowl, stir together the butter, 1/8 teaspoon garlic powder, and 1 tablespoon of parsley. Spread the butter mixture 1/2 inch thick onto a piece of aluminum foil, and place in the freezer to harden. Place the cereal in a large plastic resealable bag, and crush with a rolling pin. Add the remaining parsley, 1 1/2 teaspoons garlic powder, paprika and salt, seal the bag, and shake to mix. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch baking dish. Remove the slab of butter mixture from the freezer, and slice into 6 strips. Place one strip onto the center of each pounded chicken breast, roll up and secure with toothpicks. Dip rolled chicken breasts into buttermilk, then into the cereal mixture. Place coated breasts into the prepared baking dish. Bake, uncovered, for 30 to 40 minutes until chicken is no longer pink, and the juices run clear. The outside should be crispy and golden. This is the BEST! I was raised on this, and it is the best chicken Kiev you'll ever have. After you make it a few times it's a snap. I do this by memory. You can adjust the flavors to taste. This recipe tastes great as leftovers also!

In a medium bowl, mix the brown sugar, pecans, flour, and 1/3 cup melted butter. Sprinkle this mixture over the mashed sweet potato mixture. Bake 30 minutes in the preheated oven. Allow to sit at least 10 minutes before serving. This is a simple recipe for sweet potato casserole. But it is also the best I have tasted, enriched with eggs, milk, and rum, and topped with a crunchy pecan streusel. It is a standard at all holiday dinners in my family. The amount of rum can be varied according to taste (the casserole is also good without it.)
In a large Dutch oven place sweet potato, eggplant, peppers, carrots, onion, and three tablespoons oil. Saute over medium heat for 5 minutes. In a medium saucepan place 3 tablespoons olive oil, garlic, turmeric, curry powder, cinnamon, salt and pepper and saute over medium heat for 3 minutes.

Mash any unpopped berries. Turn off heat and drizzle 2 or 3 drops of ghost pepper hot sauce. Let cranberry sauce cool to room temperature and transfer to a serving bowl. Remove cinnamon stick and star anise pod before serving. This is a slightly unusual and awesomely delicious condiment for the center of your holiday table. It contains ghost pepper hot sauce for a special kick.
Mix chicken, soy sauce, sherry, and cornstarch in a bowl. Heat 1 tablespoon vegetable oil in a large skillet or wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir broccoli, bell pepper, zucchini, and garlic for 2 to 3 minutes. Add chicken broth, cover, and simmer until vegetables are tender, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer vegetables and sauce to a large bowl and wipe skillet clean. Heat remaining 1 tablespoon vegetable oil over medium-high heat; cook and stir chicken until meat is no longer pink in the center, about 5 minutes. Stir in vegetables; continue to cook and stir for 2 to 3 minutes more. Sprinkle with green onions. This is one of my favorite stir-fry recipes. Simple, quick, and easy. Serve over rice.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking pan with aluminum foil. Arrange the mahi mahi fillets in the prepared baking pan. Pour lemon juice over the fillets, and sprinkle with thyme and basil. Top each fillet with pineapple. Pour milk into the pan, not directly on the fish. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, or until fish flakes easily with a fork. This is something I made my first year of college and it turned out great.
Process walnuts, parsley, sage, and garlic together in a food processor until coarsely ground. With the food processor still running, slowly stream olive oil into the mixture until completely integrated into a smooth mixture. Add Pecorino Romano cheese, salt, and pepper; continue to process until the mixture has the consistency of a loose paste. Very tasty, quick, and easy pesto. We use it on soups and sandwiches. It's ready to use right away but I like to make it a day or two before I need it so the flavor can develop. I usually use my Ninja® since its easier to clean than the food processor.
Trim lamb shoulder steak from bones and set aside bones. Cut steak into 1 inch cubes and set aside. Place shoulder and neck bones in a large stockpot and cover with water; simmer bones over medium high heat for 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Remove bones from stockpot and discard. Reserve liquid. Add the cubed lamb, lentils, onions, garlic and thyme to the liquid in the stockpot; cook over medium heat for 15 minutes. Add apples and wine to the stockpot and cook another 15 minutes, or until lentils and lamb are tender. Season with salt and pepper. Serve in bowls sprinkled with cilantro. This hearty, savory soup was born when I threw together a bunch of ingredients I had lying around. It makes a perfect dinner on a rainy or snowy day.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil; cook the fettuccini at a boil until cooked through yet slightly firm, about 6 minutes; drain. Season the scallops salt. Heat olive oil in a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat and cook the scallops until golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Transfer scallops to a plate. Pour the clam juice into the skillet. Whisk together the low-fat milk, flour, white pepper, and 1/8 teaspoon salt until the mixture is smooth; whisk into the clam juice.

The most requested dinner when friends and family come to visit from all over the country. It's so easy and trust me...I hate capers, but they add just the right flavor.  If you really don't like capers, put them in a empty tea bag, fasten with a twist tie and throw it away before serving, but trust me I've had no complaints! This is a perfect dinner to entertain with or just for a romantic night for two. Suggestion: Have a nice but simple spinach salad and a good gourmet Italian bread with it.

Repeat once more to make a layered fruit stack that looks like a cake. Thinly slice a few pieces of remaining melon and pineapple. With cookie cutters or a sharp knife, cut remaining fruit slices into decorative shapes. Decorate the cake tiers with the cut fruit shapes and remaining berries. Refrigerate until serving time. To serve, slice the cake with a sharp knife, one wedge at a time, and set the wedge onto a plate. This cake was a hit with the children and parents at our two-year-old's birthday party.  It is perfect for raw, vegan, gluten/wheat-free, refined sugar-free diets (and children who don't need sugar!).  This cake was inspired by a 100% watermelon cake we had the year before.

Place the dough on the floured work surface and turn at a 90 degree angle from the last time you rolled it out. Roll again into a rectangle again and fold into thirds. If the dough is still cold and manageable, rotate and roll again, then fold into thirds, or refrigerate and continue in 30 minutes. Finish by rolling the dough out to the size of a baking sheet. Place on a lightly floured baking sheet and wrap in plastic. refrigerate for at least 30 minutes before using. To use, roll out dough to 1/4 inch thickness and cut into shapes with a sharp knife.

Stem grapes into a medium mixing bowl.  Crush with hands. Cover with cheesecloth, and set aside for three days at room temperature. After three days there should be bubbles in the grape juice, indicating fermentation has begun.  Strain liquid, and discard skins.  Return to bowl, and stir in 1 cup whole wheat flour.  Set aside for 24 hours at room temperature. Measure 1 cup starter, discard any extra, and transfer to a 1 quart glass or ceramic container with a lid. Stir in 1 scant cup bread flour and 1 cup water.  The mixture should resemble a thick batter; add more water or flour if necessary to achieve this consistency. Cover loosely with lid.  Let stand at room temperature for 24 hours. Repeat the following day.  Some activity should be noticeable: the mixture should be starting to bubble.   Repeat twice more. You will need to discard some of the mixture each day. Starter should be quite active.  Begin feeding regularly, every 4 to 6 hours, doubling the starter each time. For instance, if you have 1 cup starter, add 1 cup bread flour and 1 cup water. Alternatively, store in the refrigerator, and feed weekly. Use unwashed, organically grown red or purple grapes for this recipe. The white powder found on the skins of the grapes is yeast.   If you wish, you can switch to bread flour on the 5th day.  The starter is fully active and ready to use in 9 days.

In a large skillet, heat vegetable oil over high heat.  Brown chicken pieces in hot oil.  Turn frequently until golden brown on all sides.  Transfer chicken to a dish, leaving oil in pan.  Set chicken aside, but keep warm. Make a roux by whisking flour into the hot vegetable oil.  Turn heat down to low.  Continue cooking flour and oil mixture, stirring constantly, until it reaches a dark brown color. This may take 30 to 45 minutes;  the darker the roux, the better the final gumbo. When the roux is a dark brown color, quickly add the sausage, onion, green onion tops, green pepper, parsley, and garlic.  Cook over low heat until the vegetables are wilted, about 10 minutes, stirring constantly. Stir in 2 cups water and spices.  Add chicken parts.  Add rest of the water slowly.

Bake on lowest rack in very hot preheated oven, 450 degrees F (230 degrees C), for 15 to 20 minutes.  When baked, loosen edges with pointed knife.  Allow tarts to stand for at least 10 minutes before removing from tins. My mom used to make these a lot when I was a child.  These were so good that there was nothing like them.  I could never eat enough of these, and you will see that when you make these syrupy tarts.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add rotini pasta and cook until al dente, 7 to 10 minutes. Drain, cover, and set aside until needed. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-high heat, and stir in 1 tablespoon olive oil. Add 1 cup broccoli; toss and cook just until tender, about 5 minutes. Sprinkle broccoli with flour, and cook 1 minute. Stir in the chicken broth, and bring to a boil. Pour in the milk, and stir to blend. Season with salt, pepper, and chipotle pepper powder, if desired. Reduce heat to medium, and simmer mixture until sauce thickens, 8 to 10 minutes. Mix in 1 cup Cheddar cheese and stir until melted. Remove from heat. Heat the remaining 2 tablespoons olive oil in another large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in the onion, ground chicken, and remaining 1 cup of broccoli. Cook and stir until chicken is evenly browned and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper. Reduce heat, and cook until liquid is reduced, about 5 minutes. Preheat oven broiler to High. Lightly grease 9x13 inch baking dish. Toss the pasta with the broccoli sauce until evenly blended. Stir in the sour cream, if desired. Stir the broccoli sauce mixture into the chicken mixture. Spoon into the prepared baking dish. Top with remaining 1 cup Cheddar cheese. Cook under preheated broiler until cheese melts and browns around the edges, 3 to 5 minutes. This casserole is a hit with my whole family. Even my children enjoy eating their broccoli with this homemade meal.
Melt chocolate and the butter together. Let cool and blend in the sour cream, vanilla, and salt. Gradually add the confectioner's sugar until the frosting is of spreading consistency, beat well. Sour cream brings the tangy to this quick and easy chocolate frosting recipe.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Grease a baking sheet. Mix the cheese, butter, flour, and paprika together using an electric mixer or food processor. Take tablespoon-size pieces of the dough and one olive per tablespoon of dough. Roll the dough around the olive, so that the olive in completely enclosed in the center of the dough. Arrange the olive and cheese balls on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 15 minutes. A baked appetizer made of an olive wrapped in a scrumptious cheese mixture. It is an easy appetizer and always a favorite.
Generously grease a large slab or baking sheet. In a saucepan over medium heat, combine brown sugar, white sugar and milk.  Bring to a boil.  Stir in butter, pecans and vanilla.  Heat, without stirring, to between 234 and 240 degrees F (112 to 116 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms a soft ball that flattens when removed from the water and placed on a flat surface.  Remove from heat and let cool 5 minutes. Beat until thickened, then pour immediately onto prepared surface and let rest until firm and completely cool before cutting. Pecans are cooked to the soft ball stage with brown sugar, white sugar, evaporated milk and butter and then beaten and poured on a slab to firm up in these sweet, chewy candies.
Mix paprika, ancho chile powder, black pepper, and allspice together in a spice shaker or bowl. Place pork chops on a plate and coat both sides of chops with spice mixture. Sprinkle the remaining spice mixture onto the plate and pat the outsides of each chop into the spice mixture until entire chop is coated. Put coated pork chops in a resealable plastic bag and refrigerate for flavors to absorb into the pork chops, 4 to 12 hours. Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Place pork chops in the hot oil and reduce heat to medium; season with salt. Cook pork chops until partially blackened, 5 to 6 minutes per side. Transfer pork chops to a sheet of aluminum foil and wrap edges together creating a seal. Allow pork chops to "cook" from the residual heat inside the foil wrap, about 10 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C). Place pork chops on a serving plate and spoon residual juices in the foil over each chop. This chile-rubbed pork chop video recipe is a kinder, gentler version of the 'blackened' cooking technique. We start on high heat, but cook the chops on medium, and then finish the cooking by wrapping the chops in foil. This produces a very moist chop, as the meat has time to 'rest' as it finishes cooking.
Heat vegetable oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat. Add chicken, and cook until it begins to brown on the edges, but is still pink in the center, about 7 minutes. Stir in garlic, red pepper flakes, black pepper, and salt. Cook and stir until the garlic has begun to soften, and the chicken has become firm, about 3 minutes. Stir in potatoes, carrots, and onion. Whisk hot pepper paste into soy sauce until dissolved, then pour into saucepan along with the water. Bring to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer until the chicken is no longer pink in the center, and the potatoes are tender, about 25 minutes. Stir occasionally. This spicy, slow-cooked dish of chicken, potatoes, and carrots is best accompanied by white sticky rice. This is very, very spicy.
In a medium bowl, blend the Cheddar cheese, cream cheese and Roquefort cheese with a fork until smooth. On a large sheet of wax paper, sprinkle paprika. Form cheese mixture into desired shape, and roll in the paprika until covered. Sprinkle mixed nuts on wax paper. Roll cheese mixture in mixed nuts until coated. Place in a medium bowl between sheets of wax paper, and chill in the refrigerator until serving. Roquefort cheese and paprika give this cheese ball its special, bold flavor. Chopped mixed nuts form a pleasant, crunchy coating.  
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil and lightly coat with cooking spray. Combine walnut halves, pecan halves, almonds, and cashews in a large bowl. Add salt, black pepper, cumin, and cayenne pepper; toss to coat. Heat sugar, water, and butter in a small saucepan over medium heat until the butter is melted. Cook for 1 minute and remove from heat. Slowly pour butter mixture over the bowl of nuts and stir to coat. Transfer nuts to the prepared baking sheet and spread into a single layer. Bake nuts in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Stir nuts until the warm syrup coats every nut. Spread into a single layer, return to the oven, and bake until nuts are sticky and roasted, about 6 minutes. Allow to cool before serving. I find this technique much easier than the stovetop pan method. You'll get beautiful, perfectly frosted nuts that are roasted evenly, with no bitter burned spots.
Stir 1 tablespoon of the sugar and the yeast into the warm water in a small bowl. The water should be no more than 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). Let stand for 5 minutes until the yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam. Whisk together the cinnamon and 2 tablespoons sugar in a small bowl; set aside. Beat together the eggs, applesauce, salt, and the remaining 1 tablespoon of sugar in a large bowl. Stir in the yeast mixture. Beat in half of the flour mixture until no dry spots remain. Stir in the remaining flour, a 1/2 cup at a time, mixing well after each addition to form a sticky dough. Turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead until fairly smooth but still sticky, about 8 minutes. Lightly oil a large bowl, then place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a light cloth and let rise in a warm place (80 to 95 degrees F (27 to 35 degrees C)) for 30 minutes. Grease a 9x13 inch baking pan. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Roll the dough into a 16x20 inch rectangle. Spread the honey over the dough; sprinkle evenly with the cinnamon sugar and raisins. Beginning with the long side, roll the dough tightly into a log shape, and pinch to seal the seam. Cut into 12 equal size pieces. Place the rolls into the prepared pan cut side up. Cover the pan with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 30 minutes. Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, about 30 minutes. A great substitute for those heavy, buttery cinnamon roll recipes. This one will blow you away. Just remember that the dough before the first rising may be a bit sticky, but not adding any more flour at this point guarantees a fluffy masterpiece.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a medium bowl, stir together the sugar, cinnamon, cardamom, ginger, allspice and salt. Divide into two equal parts, and set one aside. Add the flour and butter to the other half, and stir until blended. It should be slightly grainy. Press the dough evenly into an 8 inch square pan. Cut into 1x2 inch pieces using a knife, and prick with the tines of a fork. This will keep the shortbread from warping while baking. Sprinkle the reserved sugar and spice liberally over the top, brushing into all of the cuts and holes. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes in the preheated oven, or until firm and golden at the edges. Do not brown. Cool completely in the pan, and break into pieces along the lines to serve. This is a medieval Scottish shortbread recipe. It has been a holiday favorite for my family and friends for years. The shortbread keeps very well in an airtight tin or tightly wrapped in tinfoil.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Boil the tagliatelle until cooked through yet slightly firm, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. Drizzle olive oil over the cooked pasta and toss gently to coat. Heat the cream in a saucepan over low heat until warm; stir in the blue cheese, garlic powder, lemon juice, salt, black pepper, white pepper, nutmeg, oregano, and basil. Cook very gently until the blue cheese has melted and the sauce is hot, but don't let the sauce boil. Place the tagliatelle in a serving dish and pour the sauce over the pasta. Top with walnuts to serve. An easy and quick romantic lunch or dinner recipe that will surely impress! Replace the walnuts with pine nuts, if so moved.
In a Dutch oven over medium heat, melt butter and saute the onion until tender. Pour in chicken broth and water. Mix in celery, carrots, and potatoes. Cook 10 minutes, stirring occasionally, until vegetables are tender. In a small bowl, whisk together 1 1/2 cups milk and cake flour. Mix into the Dutch oven. Mix remaining milk, celery salt, salt, and pepper into the Dutch oven. Stirring occasionally, continue cooking the mixture about 10 minutes, until thickened. Stir catfish into the mixture, and cook 5 minutes, or until fish is easily flaked with a fork. Mix in Cheddar cheese, and cook another 5 minutes, until melted. We have a large pond in our back yard which has many nice catfish so I am always trying to come up with new ways to fix it. This is one of our favorites.
Prepare dip mix according to package directions. Peel, seed and dice cucumber; add to prepared dip along with dill weed. Delicious with chips or vegetables. Classic ranch dip gets a cool treatment with the addition of chopped cucumber and dill.

I brought this to a BBQ and folks used it as a burger topping. YUMMMMMY.
In a medium bowl, cream butter and sugar.  Beat in eggs.  Stir in potato flour, water and lemon juice.  Chill until ready to use. This recipe contains raw eggs. We recommend that pregnant women, young children, the elderly and the infirm do not consume raw eggs.
Mix flour, oats, baking soda, and salt in medium bowl. Using an electric mixer, beat peanut butter, brown sugar, butter, honey, egg, and vanilla in large bowl until well blended.  Stir dry ingredients into the peanut butter mixture in 2 additions.  Stir in chopped chocolate. Cover and refrigerate until dough is firm and no longer sticky, about 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Butter 2 heavy large baking sheets. With hands, roll 1 heaping tablespoonful of dough for each cookie into 1 3/4 inch diameter ball.  Arrange cookies on prepared baking sheets, spacing 2 1/2 inches apart. Bake cookies until puffed, beginning to brown on top and still very soft to touch, about 12 minutes.  Cool cookies on baking sheets for 5 minutes.  Using metal spatula, transfer cookies to rack and cool completely. (Can be made 2 days ahead.  Store in airtight container at room temperature.) The addition of honey, oats and chocolate chunks in this recipe makes a terrific interpretation of the All-American Peanut Butter Cookie!

Place rib roast on a plate and bring to room temperature, about 4 hours. Preheat an oven to 500 degrees F (260 degrees C). Combine butter, pepper, and herbes de Provence in a bowl; mix until well blended. Spread butter mixture evenly over entire roast. Season roast generously with kosher salt. Roast the 4-pound prime rib (see footnote if using a larger and smaller roast) in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Turn the oven off and, leaving the roast in the oven with the door closed, let the roast sit in the oven for 2 hours. Remove roast from the oven, slice, and serve. This is a specific formula for achieving a perfectly pink prime rib cooked somewhere a shade under medium rare. To use this method you must have a full-sized, modern oven with a digital temperature setting that indicates when it is preheated. Older ovens with manual controls can vary greatly, and the doors may not have the proper insulation.
Place potatoes and green beans into a large pot. Pour enough water over potatoes and green beans just to cover and season with salt and pepper; bring to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 20 minutes. Place bacon in a large skillet; cook and stir over medium-high heat until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Stir flour into bacon until flour forms a paste, 2 to 3 minutes. Mix bacon mixture into potato mixture; bring to a boil and cook until thickened, 5 to 10 minutes. Mix vinegar and sugar into soup. This is a tangy soup that my mother used to make. I couldn't find another recipe like it, so thought I would write it down for my own sake and share it for others.
Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Stir in the onions, and cook about 10 minutes, until browned. Remove from heat, and set aside.

Keep in mind that the blue cheese will be salty. Place in the prepared baking dish. Bake for 20 minutes in the preheated oven, or it  may take longer if your chops are thicker. Cook until the stuffing is hot, and chops are to your desired degree of doneness. Garnish with fresh parsley and serve. This is an amazing recipe I made up to make something fancier from good ol' pork chops. This is a rich recipe.  To add another twist, add fresh chopped apples and pecans to the blue cheese mixture.

Pour 4 32-ounce cartons of low-sodium chicken broth into a large stock pot and stir in kosher salt, savory, thyme, sage, and rosemary. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium, and cook the brine for 7 minutes to blend flavors. Cool. Pour the mixture into a 5-gallon food-grade bucket, large cooler, or large brining bag. Stir apple juice and 1 gallon of water into the mixture. Place turkey, breast side down, into the brine and pour in more water if needed to cover. Place in refrigerator and brine for at least 36 hours. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Remove turkey and discard used brine. Rinse turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Place the turkey with breast side down on a roasting rack set into a roasting pan. Stuff the bird with 2 onions, 4 stalks of celery, and 4 carrots; place remaining 2 onions, 4 stalks of celery, and 4 carrots into the roasting pan surrounding the turkey. Brush outside of the turkey with 1/4 cup melted butter and pour white cooking wine and 2 32-ounce cartons of chicken broth into the pan. Roast in the preheated oven for 30 minutes; baste with pan juices. If skin begins to darken too quickly, place a tent of aluminum foil over the bird. Continue roasting for 1 1/2 more hours, basting every 30 minutes. Turn the turkey over so it is breast side up; brush with remaining 1/4 cup melted butter. Continue roasting, basting every 30 minutes, until an instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching bone, reads 180 degrees F (80 degrees C), about 1 more hour (3 hours roasting time in all). Remove turkey and set aside while you make the gravy. Strain all the pan drippings through a mesh strainer into a large saucepan. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and simmer. Whisk 2 cups water, 1 32-ounce carton turkey broth, and cornstarch together in a bowl until smooth. Whisk the cornstarch mixture into the hot pan drippings and cook until thickened, whisking constantly, about 5 minutes. Let gravy cool to thicken slightly. If desired, use a gravy separator to remove excess fat. Serve turkey with gravy. This turkey is incredibly moist and delicious. Even after heating up leftovers days later the meat is still so tender, moist and delicious. I make this primarily for Thanksgiving and have gotten nothing more than rave reviews every time! You can substitute turkey broth for chicken broth in this recipe. Brining cuts down the cooking time.
Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Add carrots and cook until tender but still firm.  Drain, cool and grate into a large bowl. In a small saucepan, whisk together the tomato sauce, oil, sugar, vinegar, mustard and Worcestershire sauce.  Bring to a boil, whisking constantly, remove from heat and cool. Add onions and mint leaves to the carrots, and pour the dressing over all.  Toss until evenly coated and chill for 24 hours before serving. Carrots are cooked until tender, grated, and then topped with tomato dressing and mint. Note: You could try using julienne carrots instead of grated, if you like.
Place red beans into a large container and cover with several inches of cool water; let stand 8 hours to overnight. Drain and rinse. Combine beans, ham hock, and salt in a stockpot; pour in enough water to cover. Bring bean mixture to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer until beans are softened, 30 to 40 minutes. Stir onion, green bell pepper, parsley, tomato sauce, green onions, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, black pepper, oregano, thyme, cayenne pepper, and hot sauce into bean mixture. Cover stockpot and cook until vegetables are tender, about 1 hour. Mix sausage into bean mixture and cook for another 45 minutes. Remove ham hock before serving. This is the best red beans recipe I have found. Serve over rice.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Put cubes in a large bowl and season generously with creole seasoning. Melt butter in a saucepan over medium-low heat. Stir Parmesan cheese, garlic, and onion powder into the melted butter; pour over the bread cubes and toss to coat. Spread bread cubes onto a large baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven for 10 minutes, stir, and continue baking until golden brown and crispy, about 10 minutes more. These are like mini garlic bread bites, a perfect addition to caesar salads, soups, or just to munch on! You will never buy another crouton again.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium casserole dish. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Place pasta in the pot, cook for 8 to 10 minutes, until al dente, and drain. In a skillet over medium heat, cook the sausage until evenly brown. In the prepared casserole dish, mix the cooked pasta, sausage, and pasta sauce. In a bowl, mix the cottage cheese, olives, and mozzarella cheese. Spoon the cheese mixture over the sausage and pasta mixture. Top with pepperoni slices. Bake 25 minutes in the preheated oven, until bubbly and lightly browned. Spaghetti with a twist! Your standard spaghetti topped with a combination of mozzarella/cottage cheese and a layer of pepperoni to top it off. The sausage can be substituted with hamburger.
Stir together the hot sauce, brown sugar, butter, honey, and lemon juice in a saucepan over medium heat. Stir continuously for 3 to 4 minutes, until the sugar has dissolved and the mixture is well blended. Remove from heat, and set aside. Coat a casserole dish with olive oil. Poke holes in the salmon with a fork, then place into the dish. Pour reserved sauce over the fish, top with green onions, and season with salt and pepper. Marinate for 30 minutes. Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 C). Bake salmon in preheated oven, uncovered, until the fish flakes easily with a fork, about 25 minutes. This is the best salmon recipe ever! It is awesome!
Combine beans and 2 tablespoons of picante sauce in a small saucepan over low heat. Cook until heated through. In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, cook the ground beef with taco seasoning mix according to seasoning mix package directions. Cover, and keep warm while you prepare the fry bread. In a medium bowl, stir together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Stir in milk, and mix until the dough comes together. Add more flour if necessary to be able to handle the dough. On a floured surface, knead the dough until smooth, at least 5 minutes. Let the dough rest for 5 minutes. Heat oil in a large, deep heavy skillet to 365 degrees F (180 degrees C). Oil should be about 1 1/2 inches deep. Break off 3/4 cup sized pieces of dough, and shape into round discs 1/4 inch in thickness, making a thinner depressed area in the center. Fry breads in the hot oil until golden on both sides, turning only once. Drain on paper towels. Top fry bread with beans, ground beef, lettuce and cheese. Spoon picante sauce over. You can also top with other of your favorite taco toppings, such as onion, sour cream or guacamole. A yummy twist to an old favorite.  The frybread makes the difference.  It's a popular request at my house.  I do up everything but the frybread in advance, and just heat up before serving. Leftover frybread can be used as dessert - coat it with cinnamon and sugar, and drizzle with honey.
Combine the flour, yeast and butter or margarine by hand until mixture is crumbly. Stir in the egg, egg yolks, heavy cream, salt and vanilla. Mix together and let stand in the refrigerator for 8 hours or overnight. Beat the egg whites until stiff peaks are formed. Mix the walnuts, 1 1/3 cups of the sugar, the cinnamon and bread crumbs. Stir in the egg whites and let the mixture stand for 1 hour. Divide the dough into fourths. On a surface sprinkled with white sugar, roll 1/4 of the dough out very thin (you should be almost able to see through the dough) into a rectangular or square shape. Spread 1/4 of the filling over the rolled dough. Cut the dough into 2 1/2x2 1/2 inch squares. Roll each square up like a jelly roll and place on a baking sheet. Repeat with the remaining dough and filling. Keep the dough you aren't working with in the refrigerator. Bake in a preheated 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) oven for 20 minutes. Keep a close eye on these cookies as they tend to burn easily because of the sugar that is on the dough. This is somewhat like a pie dough that is filled with crushed walnuts and spices and then rolled up into logs. Very rich and delicious.
Sift together the flour, baking soda and salt; set aside. In a medium bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Beat in the eggs, one at time. Next, stir in the vanilla and buttermilk alternately with the sifted ingredients. Cover dough and chill overnight. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Generously grease cookie sheets. Drop dough by rounded teaspoonfuls onto the prepared cookie sheets, about 2 inches apart. Combine the cinnamon and sugar, sprinkle some of the mixture onto each cookie. Bake for 8 to 10 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Remove from baking sheets to cool on wire racks. These cake-like cookies are a recipe my mom made when I was a kid. They're simple, but delicious...and still my favorite!
In a medium bowl, blend together warm water, melted margarine, sugar, and 3 beaten eggs In a large bowl, mix together yeast, salt, and 7 cups of the flour. Gradually stir in liquid ingredients, and mix until dough holds together. Knead dough on a floured surface with remaining flour until smooth. Split the dough into 2 large pieces. Split the 2 large pieces into 3 pieces each. Roll each third into a rope 3/4 inch thick and braid 3 strands together. Repeat. Place shaped dough onto greased cookie sheets. Brush dough with remaining beaten egg.  Add poppy or sesame seeds, if desired. Let rise in a warm place until doubled in size. Bake in a preheated 325 degree F(165 degrees C) oven for 20 to 30 minutes. Made with quick-rise yeast, this is a sweeter, richer challah that lends itself especially well to Rosh Hashanah or other holiday uses. It is  quicker and easier than a standard double-rise recipe, so it's great for those afternoons when you're in a challah of a hurry. Challah was meant to be torn and not sliced. B'tayevon!
Preheat oven to 375  degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease a medium baking dish. To prepare the cheese sauce, melt butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour, garlic powder, salt, and pepper. Mix in milk, and stir constantly until thickened. Mix in Cheddar cheese and Swiss cheese, and continue to stir until smooth. Reduce heat to low. Layer potatoes in the bottom of the prepared baking dish. Layer onion and ham over potatoes. Top with cauliflower. Cover with the cheese sauce. Bake covered 1 hour in the preheated oven. Remove cover, sprinkle with crushed cornflakes, and continue baking 10 minutes, until vegetables are tender and surface is bubbly and lightly browned. Allow to cool about 10 minutes before serving. Here is an experimental recipe that  turned out to be a huge hit! I had many of these ingredients 'left over' from a catered luncheon, and decided to give my creativity a try. My family was glad I did!
Heat olive oil in a large frying pan over medium-high heat; cook and stir onion, garlic, and lemon pepper until onion is slightly tender, about 3 minutes. Add cod to the frying pan, flipping the cod over to coat both sides with oil. Cook cod in the onion mixture until it flakes easily with a fork, occasionally sliding fish around so it doesn't stick, about 4 minutes per side. Pour wine into the frying pan and bring to a boil while scraping the browned bits of food off of the bottom of the pan with a wooden spoon. Slide the cod around the pan, flip it over, and slide around again until coated in wine, about 1 minute. Transfer cod to a serving plate; top with onion mixture and Parmesan cheese. Goes well with asparagus.

Bake crust in preheated oven until lightly browned, about 10 minutes. Remove to cool completely. Stir cream cheese and confectioners' sugar together in a bowl. Fold whipped topping with the cream cheese mixture until smooth; spread over the cooled pretzel crust. Spread cherry pie filling over the cream cheese layer. I love this pretzel dessert. My aunt makes it every year at Thanksgiving and Christmas. It works great with strawberry and blueberry pie filling as well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). In a small bowl, combine bananas, vanilla and melted butter, until bananas are well coated.  On a cookie sheet, unroll two crescent rolls, leaving the two triangles attached to form a square.  Place 1/4 of banana mixture in the center of each pair of rolls. Bake for 11 to 13 minutes, or until pastry is golden brown.  Heat caramel topping and drizzle over dessert.  Serve warm. This is a quick, wonderful dessert that all will enjoy!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Bring water and crab boil bag to a boil in a large saucepan.

Stir flour into onion and celery mixture until vegetables are coated with flour. Combine chicken broth and milk in a bowl. Slowly stir broth and milk into onion, celery, and flour mixture until thickened. Stir seafood seasoning, garlic powder, and ground black pepper into thickened sauce. Mix thawed vegetables, diced potato, and cooked lobster meat into the sauce; simmer until potato is tender, about 8 minutes. Pour lobster filling into the prepared pie crust. Cover with remaining pie crust ,and seal by crimping the edges of the two crusts together. Cut an 'X' into top of pie crust with a sharp knife to allow steam to escape during baking. Bake pie in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 40 to 45 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 to 15 minutes to allow sauce to thicken. What's better than chicken pot pie? Lobster Pot Pie!! Wonderful and comforting pot pie that all your family and friends will ask for again and again.

This is by far the easiest chicken pot pie recipe you will find. The fantastic thing about this is you can make it for about 5 or 6 dollars if you know where to shop. It's fast, easy, and cost-effective. Fantastic recipe for students. To save dishes, I mix it right in the pie plate.
Combine the simple syrup, lemon juice and whiskey in a shaker. Fill with ice. Cover and shake for about 30 seconds, until the shaker is frosty. Strain into martini glasses and garnish with a maraschino cherry. This can also be served in tumblers full of ice. If it's not made from scratch, it ain't a Whiskey Sour.

Preheat oven to broil. Place the bell peppers on a baking sheet and broil on the top rack of the oven, using tongs to turn them as each side blackens. Place the blackened peppers in a paper bag, close tightly and allow them to cool for 20 to 30 minutes. Then peel the skin off the peppers and discard the stem and all the seeds. Chop the peppers and set aside. In a large pot over medium heat, saute the onion and garlic in the oil for 5 minutes, or until onion is translucent. Now add the chopped, roasted red bell peppers and saute for 2 to 3 more minutes. Next, add the chicken broth and the beans, stirring well.

In a medium bowl, stir together the oats, brown sugar, 1/2 cup flour, 1 teaspoon crystallized ginger, and cinnamon. Stir in the butter until the mixture is crumbly with pea sized lumps. Set aside. In a separate bowl, stir together the white sugar, 2 tablespoons flour and 2 teaspoons of crystallized ginger. Add the sliced pears, and toss to blend. Transfer to the prepared baking dish. Spread with the oat topping. Bake for 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until pears are soft and topping is golden brown. Cool slightly before serving with vanilla ice cream. Pears and crystallized ginger are baked under a crispy golden oat crust.
In a medium bowl, whisk together the rice vinegar, oil, peanut butter, soy sauce, brown sugar, ginger, and garlic.

Rinse the turkey and pat dry with paper towels. Combine savory, sage, salt, and black pepper in a bowl; rub half the herb mix inside the turkey's cavity and inside the neck cavity. Loosen turkey skin over breast and legs; rub remaining half of the herb mixture underneath the loosened skin. Rub olive oil over the entire turkey. Light 20 charcoal briquettes and place half of them on each side on the lower grate of a kettle charcoal grill. Place a drip pan or disposable aluminum baking pan in the middle of the lower grate and pour in water. When the coals are gray with ash, place a 2-inch square piece of hickory or other hardwood onto each bank of coals. Place turkey on the cooking grate and cover the grill. Monitor the heat with a grill thermometer to maintain temperature between 150 and 250 degrees F (65 to 120 degrees C); add 3 to 5 coals to each side about every 1 1/2 hours. If pieces of hardwood burn away, add more to keep a steady stream of smoke rising from the wood. If open flames erupt when you open the lid, douse them with a drizzle of water or beer. Smoke the turkey for 20 minutes per pound, about 4 hours; let the heat increase to 250 degrees F (120 degrees C) during the last hour of smoking. An instant-read meat thermometer inserted into the thickest part of a thigh, not touching a bone, should reach 165 degrees F (75 degrees C). Smoked turkey is a delightful way to cook a turkey while relaxing. I know lots of people are a bit apprehensive about preparing their first smoked turkey. I have smoked over 100 and never has a bad one. The skin is beautifully tanned and the meat is so juicy.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain.

Heat the olive oil in a large heavy skillet. Saute the onion and garlic until onion is tender, but not brown. Stir in the squid, and saute for 2 minutes. Pour in the crushed tomatoes, white wine and lemon juice. Season with cinnamon stick, bay leaves, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Bring to a boil, reduce heat, and simmer 15 to 20 minutes partially covered, stirring occasionally. Remove from heat, and mix in cooked pasta. Serve topped with grated cheese. This is the 'easy' version of the classic Greek dish macaronatha, which is octopus meat in a delicious tomato-based sauce over macaroni, topped with grated sheep's milk cheese. Squid is easier to obtain, and is usually sold already cleaned, thus the ease. Goes well with a fruity blush wine like white Zinfandel. Enjoy!
Grease a baking sheet, and set aside. In a glass bowl, combine peanuts, sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Cook in microwave for 6 to 7 minutes on High (700 W); mixture should be bubbly and peanuts browned. Stir in butter and vanilla; cook 2 to 3 minutes longer. Quickly stir in baking soda, just until mixture is foamy. Pour immediately onto greased baking sheet. Let cool 15 minutes, or until set. Break into pieces, and store in an airtight container. I have used this for years and it is very good; much easier than the traditional method and tastes just as good.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (180 degrees C). To make crust:  Mix together the butter, 1 1/3 cups flour and 1/4 cup sugar with a fork until crumbly.  Press into an 8 inch square pan and bake for 20 minutes.  Crust will look white.  Do not brown! Combine the eggs, 3/4 cup of sugar, 2 tablespoons flour, baking powder and lemon juice in a blender. Blend until well mixed.  Pour over pre-baked crust. Return to oven and bake an additional 20 minutes.  Remove from oven and sprinkle with powdered sugar.  Let bars cool before cutting.

This spicy salmon fillet may be grilled, smoked with apple chips, or roasted in the oven.
Whisk together olive oil, balsamic vinegar, and garlic until well blended. Pour over mushroom caps in a resealable bag to coat, then seal and allow to marinate for 30 minutes. Stir together mayonnaise and orange juice, and set aside. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat. Remove mushroom caps from the marinade and shake off excess. Place each mushroom cap upside down on a square piece of foil. Place roasted peppers on top, and seal. Cook on preheated grill until tender, about 15 minutes, turning occasionally. When the mushrooms are nearly done, cut open the sourdough rolls and grill until golden brown on the cut sides. To assemble the sandwiches, spread the cut sides of the rolls with orange mayonnaise, and layer with mushroom, roasted pepper, Gouda cheese, and the mixed greens. I created this recipe to taste like a mushroom sandwich we served at the Good Earth Restaurant in Santa Clara, California (which is no longer in business).  It tastes great with marinated portobello mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers, smoked gouda cheese, and spring mix!
Season ribs with salt and pepper to taste. In a large skillet, over medium-high heat, brown ribs on all sides. Place half of the onion, green pepper, and celery in the bottom of a slow cooker. Place half of the ribs on top the vegetables, then repeat layering with the remaining vegetables and ribs. In a medium bowl, stir together the tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, lemon juice, and Worcestershire sauce. Pour mixture over the top of the ribs. Cover, and cook on High for 1 hour. Reduce to Low, and cook for another 8 to 9 hours. This is an easy slow cooker recipe. This dish ranks as one of my family's favorite Sunday meals. Serve over cooked rice, using sauce as a gravy. My family is picky so I cut the green pepper and celery in larger pieces so I can pick them out before I serve the meal. It doesn't change the flavor, but my kids don't complain about the icky green stuff.
Blanch broccoli and cauliflower in a large pot of boiling water until just barely tender. Drain and rise with cold water. In a large bowl combine broccoli, cauliflower, mushrooms, pepper, celery and onion. In a medium bowl, combine the vinegar, poppy seeds, sugar, mustard, salt and vegetable oil.  Mix until well blended. Pour the marinade over the vegetables and mix well. Chill overnight before serving.  Keep any extras refrigerated. I have taken this to MANY family and pot luck gatherings and it always is a huge hit. If you have other favorite veggies, you may add, or omit something if your family doesn't like it. Broccoli, cauliflower and mushrooms are just the basics.
Thread three each shrimp and scallops alternately onto long skewers. Brush the seafood evenly with the vegetable oil. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. Reserve. Blend the ketchup with the orange juice, maple syrup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, paprika and garlic. Preheat the grill to medium-high heat and grease lightly. Brush kebobs all over with the maple-orange mixture. Grill for 2 to 3 minutes per side, basting often, or until shellfish turns opaque. Makes 4 servings. Seafood lovers will enjoy this duo of juicy shrimp and succulent scallops brushed with a sweet, citrusy glaze. The kebabs make a delicious entrée. Or, for an elegant appetizer, thread only one shrimp and scallop onto smaller skewers instead.

In a large mug, stir together the milk, vanilla and sugar. Heat in the microwave on full power for 1 minute and 30 seconds. Stir in nutmeg, and serve hot. When my boys had a hard time getting to sleep I came up with this warm milk to help calm them.

Beat mashed banana into batter; fold in walnuts. Pour batter into a 13x9-inch baking dish. Bake in preheated oven until set in the middle, about 23 minutes. Cool brownies at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes before cutting into bars. Sprinkle confectioners' sugar over the brownies. I was wondering how to zest-up the traditional brownie recipe and, coincidentally, had a banana as well. If you're a banana-lover, you'll dig this recipe! The banana also moistens the brownie bars, so it's a win-win!
Peel the onions and half lengthwise.  Thinly slice onion halves.  Place onion in a bowl of ice water, and let soak for 5 minutes.  Drain well in colander. In a large heatproof bowl, toss together the green and red cabbage, onion, carrot and vinegar. In a small skillet, heat the olive oil over moderate heat until it is hot but not smoking.  Add the caraway and mustard seeds, and cook, covered, stirring occasionally, for 1 to 3 minutes, or until the mustard seeds stop popping.  Drizzle the hot oil mixture immediately over the cabbage mixture and toss the coleslaw well.  Add salt to taste and toss again. This is a nice change for coleslaw and the tangy vinaigrette is one you will want to make over and over!  A nice accompaniment to a plain meat dish.
In a large punch bowl, stir together the drink mix, lemon-lime soda, and white cranberry juice. Taste, and stir in sugar to your liking. (I like to add the whole cup.) Float scoops of ice cream on the top. The ice cream melts somewhat and turns the punch a beautiful baby blue color with frothy white clouds floating on the top. I created this punch recipe when I went looking for a punch recipe for my Baby Shower. I really wanted blue punch because I was having a boy this time. The ice cream melts somewhat and turns the punch a beautiful baby blue color leaving frothy blue and white clouds floating on top. Everyone thought it tasted great and asked for the recipe. Its also very adaptable to your taste. The sky's the limit. Try any flavor or color of unsweetened drink mix in place of the blue.
Combine the mangos, carrot, red bell pepper, and jicama in a large bowl. Whisk the vinegar, lime juice, agave nectar, and olive oil together in a separate bowl; pour over the mango mixture.

Cook and stir beef in the hot skillet until browned and crumbly, 5 to 7 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Drain and discard grease from the beef. Cut wonton wrappers into 2 1/4-inch circles with a biscuit cutter. Press one wonton into the bottom of each muffin cup. Sprinkle even amounts of Parmesan cheese, mozzarella cheese, and ricotta cheese into each muffin cup; top each portion with even amounts of ground beef and pasta sauce. Divide 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, half the ricotta cheese, 1/2 the ground beef mixture, and 1/2 cup pasta sauce, between the muffin cups and layer, respectively, atop the wonton wrapper; repeat layering with remaining wonton wrappers, 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese, 1/2 cup mozzarella cheese, remaining ricotta cheese, remaining ground beef, and remaining pasta sauce. Top the 'cupcakes' with remaining Parmesan cheese and mozzarella cheese.

Stir in onion soup mix and garlic; season with salt and pepper. Sprinkle in the Monterey Jack, Cheddar cheese and turkey.  Stir until the cheese is melted and the meat is heated through.  Spoon sauce over pasta and serve. This is a tasty cheesy pasta dish that's a great way to use leftover turkey.  Chicken can also be used instead of turkey.
Boil apple cider and maple syrup in a heavy saucepan over medium-high heat until reduced to 1/2 cup (about 20 minutes). Remove from heat and mix in 1/2 of the thyme and marjoram and all of the lemon zest. Add the butter or margarine and whisk until melted. Add salt and ground pepper to taste. Cover and refrigerate until cold (syrup can be made up to 2 days ahead). Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Place oven rack in the lowest third of oven. Wash and dry turkey. Place turkey in a large roasting pan. Slide hand under skin of the breast to loosen breast skin. Rub 1/2 cup of the maple butter mix under the skin of the breast. If planning on stuffing turkey do so now. Rub 1/4 cup of the maple butter mixture over the outside of the turkey. With kitchen string tie legs of turkey together loosely. Arrange the chopped onion, chopped celery and chopped carrot around the turkey in the roasting pan. If desired the neck and giblets may be added to the vegetables. Sprinkle the remaining thyme and marjoram over the vegetables and pour the chicken stock into the pan. Roast turkey at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 30 minutes. Reduce oven temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and cover turkey loosely with foil (shiny side towards turkey). Continue to roast until very tender, basting occasionally with pan juices. About 3 to 4 hours unstuffed, 4 to 5 hours stuffed. Pierce the leg joint with a fork, if the juices run clear or faintly pink then the turkey is done. Transfer turkey to a platter and cove with foil. Reserve pan mixture for gravy. To Make Gravy: Strain pan juices into a measuring cup. Spoon fat from juices. Add enough chicken stock to make 3 cups.

Melt the butter in a large pot over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and flour, and cook and stir until the garlic is fragrant but not browned, about 1 minute. Whisk in heavy cream and milk, whisking constantly until the mixture is hot and slightly thickened, about 10 minutes. Gradually stir in the Parmesan cheese and fontina cheese. Season with salt and black pepper. Continue to simmer until the cheese has melted and the sauce is thickened, stirring often, 20 to 30 more minutes. This is a rich, creamy, Italian-style Alfredo sauce perfect for chicken and seafood pastas! I discovered this recipe after relentless searching for an authentic Alfredo sauce that doesn't use cream cheese.
Heat vegetable oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook duck legs in the hot oil, skin-side down, until duck legs are browned and skillet contains rendered duck fat, about 10 minutes on the skin side. Flip and cook 3 to 4 minutes on the meat side. Remove duck legs from skillet, leaving rendered duck fat in the skillet. Whisk 1 cup flour into the duck fat, adding enough vegetable oil to make the flour mixture a thick and smooth roux. Turn heat to medium-low and cook the roux, stirring constantly, until it turns a rich reddish-brown color, about 40 minutes. Whisk 2 more tablespoons flour into roux and cook for 2 minutes. Whisk chicken broth into roux, 1 cup at a time, until all broth has been incorporated. Remove roux mixture from heat. Brown andouille sausage in a large Dutch oven over medium heat, about 8 minutes; stir in onion, peppers, celery, and 4 green onions, cooking until onion is translucent, about 10 minutes. Stir thyme, bay leaf, black pepper, and cayenne pepper into sausage mixture, followed by diced tomatoes. Stir to combine. Place smoked ham hock into the center of the sausage and vegetables. Pour roux mixture over ham hock along with enough water to cover. Place duck legs into mixture. Bring to a simmer, turn heat to low, and cover with a lid set at an angle to let steam out. Simmer slowly, stirring occasionally until duck and ham hock meat are tender, about 4 hours. Skim as much fat as possible off the top as it simmers. Remove duck and ham hock to a bowl and let cool. Stir pickled okra into gumbo. Pick meat from duck legs and pork hock and return meat to the gumbo. Simmer gumbo for 45 more minutes. Turn heat to medium-high, bring gumbo to a boil, and stir in shrimp and crawfish tails. Cook until shrimp and crawfish tails are bright pink, about 3 minutes. Stir in 1 tablespoon green onion, taste and adjust seasoning, and serve. This can be made with hundreds of different combinations of smoked meats, game, poultry, and seafood, and in my opinion, the more the merrier. The procedure is pretty straightforward, although you're talking about a full day's project. Serve in a large soup plate with a scoop of cooked white rice, a sprinkle of green onion, and a pinch of cayenne.
In large bowl, whisk egg white until frothy, but not stiff.  Stir in confectioners' sugar and peppermint extract.  You  may need to knead it with your hands.  If you wish to add food coloring, knead it in, and keep kneading until the color is evenly distributed. Line a cookie sheet with parchment paper.  Form the dough into small balls, place on cookie sheet and flatten slightly.  Cover and let sit overnight in a cool, dry place, until set. The creams need to set overnight. If you wish to use chocolate, melt 2 ounces chocolate chips, then dip half of the cookie into it. You may also knead in food coloring before you mold them.
Heat oil in a skillet over medium-high heat; saute onion and celery until softened, 5 to 10 minutes.

We also like it with green peas on the side.
Generously season both sides of roast with salt and pepper. Sprinkle flour over the top until well coated, and pat it into the meat. Shake off any excess. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat until hot. Sear the roast on both sides for 5-6 minutes each, until well browned. Remove from the skillet and set aside. Reduce the heat to medium and stir in mushrooms and butter; cook for 3-4 minutes. Stir in onion; cook for 5 minutes, until onions are translucent and begin to brown. Add garlic, stir for about a minute. Stir in 1 1/2 tablespoons flour; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Add tomato paste, and cook for another minute. Slowly add chicken stock, stir to combine, and return to a simmer. Remove skillet from the heat. Place carrots and celery in the slow cooker. Place roast over the vegetables and pour in any accumulated juices. Add rosemary and thyme. Pour onion and mushroom mixture over the top of the roast. Cover slow cooker, turn to high and cook the roast for 5-6 hours, until the meat is fork tender. Skim off any fat from the surface and remove the bones. Season with salt and pepper to taste. The real secret here is making sure you sear the meat before the long, slow braising.

Increase heat to medium-high and bring to a simmer. Transfer browned short ribs into coconut milk mixture. Reduce the oven temperature to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C) and bake until ribs are tender when pierced with a fork, 3 hours. Remove Dutch oven from the oven, transfer short ribs to a small bowl, and set aside. Return Dutch over to the stove top over high heat. Skim fat from top as it begins to boil and remove any bones that may have fallen from the meat. Stir in cauliflower and cover Dutch oven. Cook until cauliflower is tender, about 5 minutes. Remove bones from short ribs and place meat in the Dutch oven. Stir in green onions and basil leaves; season with salt and pepper to taste. This simple, braised beef short ribs recipe combines the best of our country's classic stews with the exotic spices we associate with the cuisine of Asia.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly grease a baking sheet. Line a 10-inch pie dish with 1 sheet of puff pastry. Trim the edge so 1 inch hangs over the rim of the dish.

Check for doneness after 30 minutes. Cool another 30 minutes before serving. This is a wonderful, savory, quiche-like pie that I use as a brunch entree and also as a vegetarian main dish to supplement my traditional Thanksgiving dinner for family and friends. It could also be altered for use as an appetizer if made using mini-tart pan. It always gets rave reviews!
Beat egg whites and salt until foamy in a large glass or metal mixing bowl until stiff peaks form. Lift your beater or whisk straight up: the egg whites should form a sharp peak that holds its shape. Beat the egg yolks to soft peaks in a separate bowl. Beat the butter and confectioners' sugar in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the egg yolks and vanilla to the butter mixture; mix. Stir in the nutmeg, cloves, allspice, and the egg whites; beat until well blended. Batter can be frozen or kept in refrigerator for several weeks. To make a Tom and Jerry, fill a cup of hot water with spiced rum or brandy, warm milk, hot cocoa, or eggnog and stir in 1 heaping tablespoon of batter. This is a holiday drink that my family enjoys in the winter. The batter makes an excellent topping for both alcoholic beverages as well as hot cocoa, eggnog, or warm milk for the kids.

In a large, non-aluminum stockpot, combine tomato mixture, celery seed, mustard seed, salt, sugar, and vinegar. Bring to a boil and simmer over low heat 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Sterilize enough jars and lids to hold relish (12 one-pint jars, or 6 one-quart jars). Pack relish into sterilized jars, making sure there are no spaces or air pockets. Fill jars all the way to top. Screw on lids. Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with boiling water. Carefully lower jars into pot using a holder. Leave a 2 inch space between jars. Pour in more boiling water if necessary, until tops of jars are covered by 2 inches of water. Bring water to a full boil, then cover and process for 30 minutes. Remove jars from pot and place on cloth-covered or wood surface, several inches apart, until cool. Once cool, press top of each lid with finger, ensuring that seal is tight (lid does not move up or down at all). Relish can be stored for up to a year. This delicious, tangy relish of green tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and spices,  is perfect with sandwiches, potatoes, cheese, and lots of other entrees. A jar of this makes a great gift, too!

Bring 2 quarts of water of  water to a boil in a saucepan. Add chicken, and cook for 10 to 15 minutes, or until done. Reserve chicken stock, and allow chicken to cool. Cut chicken into small cubes. In a large skillet or wok, saute pork until evenly brown. Stir in chicken, cabbage, and carrots. Cook over medium heat until cabbage is tender. Remove from heat, and allow to cool slightly while you separate the wrappers. In small bowl, combine enough flour and water to make a paste about the consistency of glue. Spoon meat mixture into a thin line on each wrapper, and roll up, using a dab of the flour paste to seal the edge. Keep each lumpia thin; if you over fill them, the wrapper will tear. Save about 1/2 to 1/4 of the filling in the pot for the pancit. Heat large skillet with 1/2 to 1 inch of oil. Fry the lumpia one side at a time, until a nice golden brown. Drain, standing each piece upright, in a pot or bowl lined with paper towel. Return the remainder of the filling to the stove, and gently mix in the pancit noodles. Gradually add the chicken stock, and cook until noodles are tender. For the sauce:  With a mortar and pestle or back of a spoon, crush the garlic, then mix into the vinegar. Serve in small bowls with spoons. The sauce can be used as a dip, or to spoon into the lumpia. This is my grandma's lumpia and pancit that she has been making since before the family moved to the U.S. when my dad was a child. This is very popular with both family and friends. As soon as my friends in high school discovered my grandma was in town, my house became THE place for lunch! She serves her lumpia with a garlic and vinegar dipping sauce.  It's very pungent, but oh so tasty. You can make a large batch of the lumpia and freeze it, so you can fry up some when ever you crave it! Spring roll wrappers are the best to use, they are thinner and lighter than egg roll wrappers.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat; cook and stir sausage, breaking meat into chunks, until crumbly and no longer pink, about 10 minutes. Transfer sausage to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Mix cooked sausage, mozzarella cheese, Parmesan cheese, and egg together in a bowl. Rough dough into a 10x14-inch rectangle on a baking sheet. Spread sausage-cheese mixture onto dough, leaving a 1-inch border. Roll dough around filling, starting from the long edge, creating a long log. Form the log into a circle and pinch edges together to seal. Brush top of roll with egg yolk. Bake in the preheated oven until ring is dark golden brown, 1 hour. Cool for 15 minutes before slicing into pieces to serve. A super-easy appetizer or snack to prepare that you can't stop eating! So scrumptious!

Heat oil in a large skillet over high heat until oil smokes. Cook and stir calamari mixture in hot oil until calamari turns white and firms, about 1 minute. Pour mixture into a large shallow serving bowl and cool to room temperature. Wrap and refrigerate until cold, about 1 hour. Toss calamari and any accumulated juices together in the bowl. Add coconut flakes, cilantro, remaining green onion, and lime juice; stir. Not only did it make a fantastic sort of Thai-like salad, I can see this dish being quite versatile as well. It was very tasty hot and would be great over rice with some of the cooked-down marinade. It would also be amazing over a big bowl of crunchy greens. Just don't skip the toasted coconut as it really does make the dish.

This is my take on the classic Korean fried chicken sauce. I like to add lots of green onion and garlic, and not cook this quite as long. The result is a sauce with those ingredients a little more in the flavor profile's forefront. Try to find Korean chili flakes and/or paste if you can. I've used them before and the flavor is great (and obviously more authentic), but if you can't, any hot chili flakes or paste will work.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Divide pastry dough in half and roll out. Fit one pastry circle into a 9 inch pie pan. Cut the other pastry circle into 1 inch strips for lattice top.

Separate 3/4 cup of the cauliflower florets and place them in a pan of boiling water. Boil for 2 to 3 minutes, then rinse under cold water, and set aside for garnish. Heat oil in a large saucepan over medium heat. Add onion, garlic, leek and celery. Cook, stirring, until tender, about 5 minutes. Add potato, chicken broth, uncooked  cauliflower and sherry. Bring to a boil, then simmer over low heat, stirring occasionally until potatoes and cauliflower are tender. Remove from heat. Puree the cauliflower mixture in batches using a food processor or blender, and transfer to a soup pot over medium-low heat. I like it smooth but still with little tiny bits in it. Season with white pepper, black pepper and salt. Stir in the milk and cream, then crumble in the Stilton cheese. Heat through, but do not boil. Ladle into bowls, and garnish with cauliflower pieces and chopped fresh parsley. I first experienced this great soup (the Stilton makes all the difference) on my honeymoon at a little cafe and bookstore near the train station in Edinburgh, Scotland.  The day was damp, misty and cool and we were tired from a long train trip from London.  I encourage you to enjoy this on a similar day along with some good chunks from a baguette.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a turkey roaster with long sheets of aluminum foil that will be long enough to wrap over the turkey. Stir together the parsley, rosemary, sage, thyme, lemon pepper, and salt in a small bowl. Rub the herb mixture into the cavity of the turkey, then stuff with the celery, orange, onion, and carrot. Truss if desired, and place the turkey into the roasting pan. Pour the chicken broth and champagne over the turkey, making sure to get some champagne in the cavity. Bring the aluminum foil over the top of the turkey, and seal. Try to keep the foil from touching the skin of the turkey breast or legs. Bake the turkey in the preheated oven for 2 1/2 to 3 hours until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear. Uncover the turkey, and continue baking until the skin turns golden brown, 30 minutes to 1 hour longer.  An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area  10 to 15 minutes before slicing. My grandmother and mother passed this recipe on to me. It changes just a little every year, because we've never written it down before. But it is always incredibly juicy and succulent!
In a nonporous glass dish or bowl, combine the mushrooms, vinegar, rosemary, and salt and pepper. Stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. Preheat grill for high heat. Brush grate with oil, and arrange marinated mushrooms on hot grill. Turn after 2 to 3 minutes, and continue grilling until mushrooms are heated through and look wilted and black. Serve hot off the grill. Portobello mushrooms marinated in balsamic vinegar and rosemary, then grilled - these are heaven. If you don't have a grill, they're also delicious fried in a skillet.  Portobello mushrooms are extremely large, dark brown mushrooms that are simply the fully mature form of the crimini mushroom, a variation of the common white mushroom.

Cool completely. Pour cooled dressing over bowl of vegetables. Toss to distribute dressing evenly. Cover tightly and store in refrigerator. This is one of the best tasting pasta salads I have ever had. My family and in-laws love it and I can never make enough. You can change or substitute the ingredients in the salad if you'd like to.   This salad is best when prepared a day ahead.

Heat deep-fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place meat on a solid, level surface and pound with a mallet until it is 1/8 to 1/4 inch thick. Place the flour and bread crumbs in separate dishes. Soup plates are useful. Lightly beat the eggs and add the milk.  Lightly season with salt and pepper and put this into another soup plate. Coat the meat in flour, patting lightly by hand.  Using a fork to hold the meat, dip into the egg mixture and drain slightly.  Next, coat with the breadcrumbs by lightly pressing the crumbs into the meat.  When each piece of meat has been prepared, deep fry in cooking oil until golden brown. Both my mother and father were Viennese and grew up there.  This was my mother's recipe.  Veal can also be used in place of pork.
Spray the inside of slow cooker with cooking spray. Stir uncooked macaroni and vegetable oil together in the slow cooker until pasta is coated. Stir Cheddar cheese, evaporated milk, milk, broccoli, salt, and black pepper with macaroni until fully combined. Cover the cooker and cook on Low until macaroni is tender and the sauce is bubbling, 2 1/2 to 3 hours, stirring often to reduce sticking. An easy slow cooker mac and cheese. The best part is no boiling of the pasta. It can be made lower fat too.
This first step is to soften the beef. Place the beef in a medium saucepan, and add enough water to cover the meat.  Cover, and simmer over low heat for at least an hour. Remove the beef from water, and set aside. Heat the oil in a wok over medium-high heat. Add in the garlic and dried shrimp, and stir fry for a few seconds before stirring in the lemon grass and onions. Reduce heat to medium, and stir in coconut milk, red curry paste, turmeric, and chile pepper. Mix in the beef, and cover the wok. Simmer for 10 minutes over medium heat. Stir in the cilantro just before serving. Save some cilantro for garnishing on top if you like. This is a special beef recipe from my country which is really tasty and there is a special technique which softens the beef until the texture is like chicken. The dried shrimp is an added flavour and modification I made to the original dish. This recipe is easy to make, and will be a hit at family gatherings. Tastes really good for steamed or spiced rice.

Cook pita bread in preheated oven until toasted and crispy, about 10 minutes. Combine tomatoes and green bell pepper in a large bowl; add eggplant and onion with vinegar and salt. Mix olive oil and sumac into tomato mixture; season with salt. Toss pita bread pieces into salad just before serving. My wife's specialty. Similar to fattoush, but with a different assortment of vegetables, including (of course) eggplant which gives this salad an extra zing! This dish was a hit at a holiday potluck. The salad is ready to serve, but letting the entire salad soak overnight is recommended.
Preheat a grill for high heat. In a medium bowl, mix together the ground beef, teriyaki marinade and French-fried onions. Form the mixture into 4 patties. Lightly oil the grilling surface, and place patties on the preheated grill. Grill for 4 to 5 minutes per side, or until well done. Top with cheese, and serve on hamburger buns. This is a fast, simple recipe for hamburgers that have a special flavor.

Increase heat to medium-high and cook until onions become slightly translucent, 3 to 5 minutes. Stir cilantro into the sauce; continue cooking until thickened to your liking, 5 to 7 minutes more. This is my version of a popular sauce that can be tweaked in a lot of ways to suit one's taste, either more to the sweet side or sour side. It's great with small fried items, like fried tofu, egg rolls, or samosas.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees . For the mashed potato crust: Make Buttery Homestyle Flavored Mashed Potatoes to package directions substituting boiling milk for the water. When the milk is incorporated, add the mayonnaise and the Parmesan. Season with the salt and pepper to taste. Cool for 5 minutes. Once cooled, add the eggs, and the flour. Mix until blended - the potatoes should appear thick and dry. For the crispy outer potato crust: Combine the 3 ingredients and set aside. For the Roast: Season the rib roast generously with salt and black pepper. Dust the outside with the all-purpose flour. Heat a cast iron or a large heavy saute pan over med-high heat. Add the canola oil and allow it to heat until simmering. Add the rib roast carefully bone-side up or fat side down. Sear until golden in color. Remove the roast and place on a sheet tray. Allow it to cool for 10 minutes. Once cooled, brush the mustard onto the fat side of the roast and the under side. Coat the roast with the potato and egg mixture.

Season with oregano, pepper, salt, thyme, parsley, and rosemary. Return to a simmer; reduce heat to medium-low, cover, and simmer 45 minutes, stirring occasionally. Add water if the sauce becomes too thick as it cooks, but remember that you'll be adding the cream soon, so don't thin it too much. Once the sauce has cooked, stir in the cream until the consistency and color are to your liking. Cook another 5 to 10 minutes to reheat. This version of vodka sauce has been passed down through a lot of generations. Everyone adds their own special twist. So, if you like, try adding your own.

Dip crusty bread into sauce to complete the entree!
Preheat oven on broiler setting. Use a fork to score the duck breasts through the skin and fat but not all the way through to the meat. Heat a large heavy skillet on medium high. Fry the duck breasts skin side down, until the skin browns and fat runs out, about 10 minutes. Remove the breasts from the pan, and pour off most of the fat. Return breasts to pan, and fry skin side up for another 10 minutes. Remove breasts from pan, and allow to rest on a baking sheet. Mix the sea salt, cinnamon and Demerara sugar together and sprinkle over the skin of the duck breasts. Pour most of the fat out of the frying pan. Mix together the red wine, cassis, and cornstarch in a small bowl. Pour into the pan, and simmer for 3 minutes, stirring constantly, until the sauce is thickened.  Add raspberries, and simmer for another minute until heated through. Broil the duck breasts skin side up, until the sugar begins to caramelize, about 1 minute. Slice the duck breasts thinly, pour a little sauce over the top, and serve warm. If you want to use frozen raspberries for this recipe, allow them to thaw first.

Drizzle with the olive oil, then season with thyme, salt, and pepper. Mix well. Bake, uncovered, in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, stirring once midway through baking. Remove the baking dish from the oven, and stir in the wine. Return to the oven, and bake until the wine has mostly evaporated and the vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes more. Stir in the beet greens, allowing them to wilt from the heat of the vegetables. Season to taste with salt and pepper before serving. Beets were my sworn enemy until I tried them like this, it's a great way to use root vegetables. I think the beets add a beautiful red color to the dish, but if it bothers you to serve pinkish vegetables, substitute parsnips, rutabaga, or any similar vegetable; be creative!
In a large glass bowl, mix together lemon juice, olive oil, soy sauce, oregano, and garlic; add pork, onions, and green peppers, and stir to coat. Cover, and refrigerate for 2 to 3 hours.

Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease an 8x12 inch baking dish. Make lavender sugar by blending the sugar and 2 teaspoons lavender buds in a blender; blend until the lavender is powdered. Blend together with an electric mixer 1/4 cup of the lavender sugar, butter, coconut oil, 2 cups flour, and salt in a bowl until a dough forms; press into the bottom of the prepared dish. Bake in the preheated oven until the top begins to turn golden brown; about 15 minutes. While the dough bakes, mix together the remaining lavender sugar, 1/4 cup flour, eggs, lemon juice, lemon extract, and 1/2 teaspoon lavender buds; pour over the baked  crust and return to the oven to bake until the center is set, about 20 minutes. Allow to cool completely and dust with confectioners' sugar before serving. I'm totally addicted to using lavender as flavoring. If you think it sounds weird, may I suggest not knocking it like I did until you try it.
Place the sausage and onion into a large saucepan over medium heat, and cook and stir until the sausage begins to brown, about 10 minutes. Stir in the black-eyed peas, chicken stock, water, and cayenne pepper, and bring to a boil. Stir in the rice, cover, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the rice is tender, 20 to 25 minutes. An easy week night dinner that my kids love. Have it with a nice salad, and dinner is done. The red pepper should be adjusted to fit your family's taste.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook and stir mushrooms and spinach until mushrooms are tender and spinach is wilted, about 3 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper; set aside. Spread one side of each bread slice with butter. Place one bread slice, buttered side down, into the skillet. Top with the Swiss cheese, then spread the mushroom mixture on top of the cheese. Cover with the second slice of bread, buttered side up. Cook until the sandwich is golden brown on both sides, turning once. Cut in half and serve hot. A great variation of the classic grilled cheese sandwich.
Cut any excess fat from the beef, reserving about 2 tablespoons of fat. Place the fat into a large pot over low heat, and cook, stirring occasionally, until the liquid fat renders out, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard any solid bits that remain. Place the beef into the hot melted beef fat, and brown on all sides over medium heat, stirring often, about 10 minutes. Cook until nearly all the beef juices have evaporated and begun to brown. Stir in the onion, and cook and stir until the onion starts to become translucent, about 2 minutes. Stir in potatoes, carrots, and turnip, and sprinkle on the flour in several batches, cooking and stirring to coat the ingredients with flour. Stir in the garlic, and cook and stir the meat and vegetables for about 2 minutes to remove any raw flour taste. In a saucepan over medium-low heat, mix the beef stock and vegetable stock together, and heat until hot but not boiling. Pour the stock mixture, Irish stout beer, barley, thyme, bay leaves, salt, and pepper over the beef and vegetables and stir to dissolve any brown flavor bits from the bottom of the pot. Bring the stew to a boil, reduce heat, cover the pot, and simmer until the meat is very tender, about 2 hours. Stir every 30 minutes, and check seasoning after 1 hour of cooking time. The cover can be removed in the last 30 minutes if you want a thicker stew. This recipe is designed to be inexpensive while still tasting good. My family would usually eat stew once per week. This is a recipe I developed myself over time, it reminds me of eating supper on Sunday night with my family. This is an adaptation of Irish stew made with lamb. In Ireland lamb was cheap, and in Canada beef is much cheaper than lamb. I'm aware of a French Canadian version that uses pork. Serve with bread.
Place bacon in a large skillet and cook over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until evenly browned, about 10 minutes. Drain the bacon slices on paper towels.

Refrigerate salad until chilled and flavors have blended, 3 hours to overnight. Crumble bacon. Mix bacon, lettuce, croutons, and water chestnuts into salad. This salad has been a family-favorite for years. Even people who don't typically like salad are surprised by how much they enjoy this dish. This is a real winner at potlucks and other large gatherings, as it makes quite a lot of salad.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan. Place the flour in a bowl and mix well; rub in the butter until the pieces are the size of small peas. Stir in the cinnamon and nutmeg. Stir in the walnuts, raisins, and apples. Add the grated lime rind, eggs, and pineapple juice. Beat well until thoroughly combined. Spoon the mixture into the prepared pan and smooth the top. Bake in preheated oven for about 1 1/4 hours, or until a tester inserted in the center of the cake comes out clean. Turn out and cool on wire rack. A nice no-added-sugar apple cake sweetened with fruit juice.
Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook until al dente, 8 to 10 minutes; drain. While the pasta cooks, melt the butter in a large, deep skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir the garlic in the butter 1 to 2 minutes; season with salt and pepper. Stir in the yellow onion and 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes; cook until the yellow onion becomes translucent. Add the crawfish tails; cook 2 to 3 minutes, stirring continually; transfer the crawfish to a bowl, leaving as many onions as possible in the skillet. Pour the heavy cream into the skillet and bring to a boil; reduce heat to low, and simmer until thickened. Sprinkle the remaining 1/2 tablespoon red pepper flakes into the cream, return the crawfish to the sauce and simmer 2 to 3 minutes. Serve sauce over the drained pasta; garnish with chopped green onion. This is a traditional crawfish dish in New Orleans. This dish can be spicy or mild depending on the amount of red pepper flakes you use, so be careful.

Heat the oil in a skillet over medium-high heat. Fry the rabbit pieces until browned on the outside. Transfer to a soup pot or large saucepan. Add the onion, garlic, green pepper, red pepper and chile pepper to the skillet; cook and stir until onion is transparent. Transfer to the saucepan. Add the tomatoes, chicken stock, salt and pepper to the saucepan, and bring to a boil. Simmer over medium-low heat for about 2 hours. Remove the rabbit pieces with a slotted spoon, and keep warm. Turn the heat up to high under the saucepan, and boil the liquid until it has reduced by half. Return the rabbit pieces to the pan, and stir in the coconut milk. Cook, stirring gently, until heated through. Serve. This is an old recipe that comes from Colombia. My family loves when I cook this. Rabbit meat is very low in fat and can be dry-tasting, so it marries well with coconut cream. It is best to cook the rabbit gently till it is falling off the bone. Serve with rice.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place halibut in a 9x13 inch baking dish. Sprinkle with seafood seasoning and lemon juice. Dot halibut with butter slices. Bake in the preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, 15 to 20 minutes. Remove pan from oven and cool halibut slightly. Flake into bite sized pieces in the baking dish.

Mix eggs, milk, salt, and nutmeg together with a fork, until the whole mixture is pale yellow.  Pour this into a low, flat pan or a large, shallow dish. If you are using English muffins, cut them in half so that you have six halves.  Let the halves or the slices of bread soak on each side in the egg mixture. Spread a layer of granulated sugar on a plate, and dip both sides of the bread in sugar. Heat a griddle or skillet over medium heat. Put about half a tablespoon of butter in the pan, and let it melt.  Place two muffin halves or slices of bread in the pan. Cook for 2 to 3 minutes on each side. Wipe old butter out of pan, and repeat with remaining slices of bread. I make this delicious French toast on snow days.  I use cinnamon-raisin English muffins rather than bread, with great results. Serve with warm maple syrup.
Place 1/3 cup sugar and milk in a small saucepan, and stir until the sugar is dissolved. Add 1/4 cup softened butter, and gently warm the mixture until the butter melts and the mixture is warm but not hot (no warmer than about 100 degrees F (40 degrees C). In a large bowl, stir together the yeast with 2 1/2 cups flour until well blended, and pour the milk mixture into the flour-yeast mixture. Stir in 1 beaten egg, and mix until the mixture forms a sticky, wet dough. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface, and knead for about 10 minutes, gradually kneading in 1 cup of additional flour or as needed to make a smooth, elastic dough. Form the dough into a round ball, place into an oiled bowl, and turn the dough around in the bowl a few times to coat with oil. Cover the bowl with a cloth, and allow dough to rise in a warm place until doubled, about 1 hour. Cream 1/4 cup softened butter with 1/2 cup of sugar in a bowl until the mixture is light and fluffy, and stir in dry milk powder, 1/2 cup flour, and the coconut until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Set the filling aside. Working on a floured surface, punch down the dough, and cut into 2 equal pieces. Cut each piece into 8 equal-sized pieces (16 pieces total). Form each piece into an oblong bun, and flatten the bun with a floured rolling pin. Scoop up about 1 tablespoon of filling with a spoon, and place in the center of a bun. Pull and pinch the edges of the dough together to enclose the filling in the bun. Repeat with all dough pieces, and place the filled buns, seam sides down, onto the prepared baking sheets. Cover the buns with a cloth, and allow to rise in a warm place 1 hour. Preheat an oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Line baking sheets with parchment paper. For a glossy coating, beat 1 egg in a bowl, and brush each bun with a little beaten egg. Sprinkle each bun with a few sesame seeds. Bake in the preheated oven until the buns are golden brown, 10 to 15 minutes. Allow to cool before serving. These cocktail buns are like the ones you get at Chinese bakeries. They are filled with a creamy coconut filling. Yum!
Bring broth to a boil in a saucepan; add zucchini, potato, and onion. Reduce heat to medium-low, cover the saucepan, and simmer until vegetables are tender, about 15 minutes. Beat eggs and lemon juice together; add 1/2 cup of the hot broth from the saucepan and beat to temper the eggs. Pour the egg mixture into the broth in the saucepan. Increase heat to medium; cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Remove saucepan from heat, stir dill into the soup, and season with salt and pepper. This is one of my favorite soups. It's a family recipe. I love that it is dairy-free since I am lactose-intolerant. Serve immediately. Refrigerate any leftovers.
Heat 1 tablespoon oil in a large skillet and saute onion until tender. Remove and set aside. Place flour, salt and pepper in a large, clean grocery bag.

Remove chicken from skillet and place in a deep roasting pan. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Heat reserved flour in skillet over medium high heat, stirring constantly, to make a dark roux. Slowly stir in pepper flakes, water and vinegar. Finally stir in reserved sauteed onion. Mix well and pour mixture over chicken. Cover dish and bake in preheated oven for about 35 to 45 minutes, or until chicken is tender and cooked through (no longer pink inside). Note: If gravy is too thick, add water to pan, a little at a time, until desired consistency is reached. This southern chicken dish will please most palates. It is an alternative to the traditional fried chicken and is great served with rice or potatoes.
Place bacon in a large, deep skillet. Cook over medium high heat until evenly brown. Drain on paper towels and set aside. Sprinkle rabbit with salt and coat with 1/3 cup flour, shaking off excess. Brown rabbit in remaining bacon fat. Remove from skillet, along with all but 2 tablespoons of the fat, and reserve. Saute shallots and garlic in skillet for about 4 minutes, until tender. Stir in wine, 1 cup water and bouillon. Heat to boiling, then stir in jelly, peppercorns, bay leaf, and rosemary. Return rabbit and bacon to skillet. Heat to boiling, then reduce heat to low. Cover and let simmer about 1 1/2 hours or until rabbit is tender. Remove bay leaf and discard. Place rabbit on a warm platter and keep warm while preparing gravy. To Make Gravy: Stir lemon juice into skillet with cooking liquid. Combine 3 tablespoons water with 2 tablespoons flour and mix together; stir mixture into skillet over low heat. Finally, stir in thyme. Pour gravy over stew and serve, or pour into a gravy boat and serve on the side. Rabbit stew made with bacon, wine, garlic, shallots, other herbs and spices.
Preheat oven to 200 degrees F (95 degrees C). Grease a 14 x 18 inch cookie sheet. Sprinkle one package of chocolate chips on prepared pan. Place in warm oven until chips melt, about 5 minutes. Remove from oven, and spread melted chocolate over bottom of pan; set aside. In a large heavy saucepan over medium-high heat, combine butter and brown sugar.  Stirring constantly, heat to 300 to 310 degrees F (149 to 154 degrees C), or until a small amount of syrup dropped into cold water forms hard, brittle threads.  Immediately remove from heat.  Stir in 3/4 cup slivered almonds and pour onto pan with melted chocolate; spread mixture evenly. Sprinkle remaining package of chocolate chips over the almond layer.  The heat from the almond layer will melt the chocolate chips; spread melted chocolate evenly.  Sprinkle remaining 1/4 cup almonds over chocolate. Cut into squares, or allow to harden in a solid sheet and break it apart like brittle.  Cool completely before removing from pan. This recipe has been in our family for years, and it is our favorite. It is delicious and addicting. Get ready to go on a diet after the holidays!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Generously grease a 9 inch springform pan with 2 3/4 inch sides. In a medium bowl, mix together crushed cookies and softened butter or margarine. Press mixture evenly into greased pan. Bake in preheated oven for 5 minutes, then allow to cool. Combine 1 cup cream, chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt, in the top of a double boiler. Heat until chocolate is fully melted and mixture is smooth. Alternatively, if you have a food processor, you can blend mixture by placing chocolate, vanilla extract, and salt, in processor bowl. Bring 1 cup cream to a boil on stovetop, then slowly pour cream into processor with blade running. Continue to process until mixture is smooth. Pour chocolate mixture into a bowl and cool to room temperature, stirring occasionally. In a large bowl, beat 2 cups chilled cream with 1/4 cup sugar. Beat until stiff peaks form. Fold whipped cream into chocolate mixture. Pour mixture into cooled crust. Chill pie at least 6 hours before serving. Prior to serving, beat remaining 1 cup cream with 1/4 cup sugar. Beat until stiff, then pipe onto top of pie with a star tip, or place a spoonful on top of each slice. I make this recipe for the holidays. It is the only pie that is gone at the end of the night. I use high-quality chocolate chips; they are easier to melt. You can use milk or semi sweet chips. You can use any ready made or cooked pie crust.
In a large mixing bowl, cream together the butter and sugar. Add the eggs and vanilla, and mix well.  Sift together the flour, baking powder, baking soda and salt; add to mixture.

Melt the ghee in a heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat; cook the cashews and raisins in the melted ghee until the raisins plump and the cashews are lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove the cashews and raisins from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Add the flour to the pan and roast till brown and nutty, about 10 minutes. Meanwhile, bring the water and sugar to a boil in a saucepan until the sugar dissolves to make a clear syrup. Stir the cardamom into the syrup; slowly pour over the roasted flour, stirring as you pour to avoid lumps. Continue cooking until the halwa pulls away from the sides of the pan, about 5 minutes more. Transfer to a serving dish and spread into an even layer; sprinkle the cashews and raisins over the halwa to serve. The inspiration for this halwa is the classic Sikh preparation called 'karha prashad.' This halwa has the addition of cardamom, raisins, and nuts. My kids love this halwa on a cold day as a snack after school.

Drop shortening and cream cheese into flour mixture; pulse another 4 or 5 times, 1 long second each, until fats are the size of peas and fine gravel. Dump mixture into a medium bowl; rub through clean fingertips to blend. Stir in water with a rubber spatula until dough clumps form. Press dough with your palm to form a ball, then divide in half. Wrap each half in plastic wrap, pressing to form thick disks. Refrigerate at least 1 hour. Adjust oven rack to lowest position and place a pizza stone or four 9-inch quarry tiles (from a hardware store) on rack to form an 18-inch square. Preheat to 400 degrees. In a large saucepan, cook 1 cup cherry juice, 1 cup sugar, potato starch and a pinch of salt over medium-low heat; stir with a rubber spatula until a very thick paste forms. Scrape paste into cherries in a bowl. Add almond extract; stir to combine. Set a dough disk on a floured work surface. Roll into a 14-inch circle. Fold in half and quickly lift into a 9-inch Pyrex pie plate (not deep-dish). Unfold. Fit dough into pie plate so it is not stretched in any way. Refrigerate. Roll remaining dough disk into a 12-inch circle. Remove pie shell from refrigerator, add fruit filling, and dot with 1 Tb. butter. Fold dough circle in half; quickly lift onto filling and unfold. Trim all around to 1/2-inch beyond lip of pie plate. Roll overhanging dough under with fingertips; flute. Set an 18-inch square of heavy-duty foil on tiles or pizza stone. Set pie on foil and bake until crust just starts to color, about 20 minutes. Remove from oven, brush with egg white, and sprinkle with 1 1/2 Tbs. sugar. Bake until golden brown, about 20 minutes longer. Bring foil up around pie to loosely cover edges. Bake until filling bubbles, 15 to 20 minutes longer. Cool on a wire rack. Cherry pie is just about the easiest fruit pie to make. Sour cherries -- the kind you need for pie -- are rarely available fresh or frozen, so the canned variety usually is the only option for most cooks. Not only do canned cherries make good pies, but there's also no peeling, coring, seeding, pitting or slicing the fruit. Just drain, dump, sweeten, flavor and thicken, and you're in business.

If you are not into sweet, then this probably isn't the recipe for you.  I would suggest squeezing a bit of lime juice over the meat in order to break up the sweetness. I have never paid attention to what type of pork chops I had either, I just grabbed and baked...but apparently it is all in the cut of the meat! I also froze a few heads of romaine lettuce for about an hour, divided it up into 8 portions, and added Parmesan cheese and dressing of choice....  MMMM!
In a clear pie pan, or similar dish, spread a layer of bean dip. Top the bean dip with a layer of guacamole. Allow the layers to thicken in the refrigerator for approximately 20 minutes. In a mixing bowl, while the bean dip and guacamole chill, combine the sour cream and taco seasoning. When the chilled mixture is sufficiently thickened, spread a layer of the sour cream mixture over the layer of guacamole. Top the sour cream layer with the grated cheese. Garnish the layers with the jalapenos and tomatoes. This is the quickest, easiest, best tasting Mexican dip ever! It's great to serve at parties. I always make two!
Heat olive oil in a saucepan over medium heat. Cook and stir garlic in hot oil until sizzling, about 30 seconds. Add kale and 2 tablespoons water to garlic, cover the saucepan with a lid, and cook until kale softens, 2 to 3 minutes. Stir oats, red pepper flakes, and salt into kale mixture; pour in enough water to cover oats. Cook and stir oats until desired consistency is reached, about 3 minutes. This adds a different twist to plain oatmeal. My sister shared it with me. She got it from her husband's Indian aunt. It makes oatmeal exciting and tasty with a bite. You can substitute spinach for the kale, if desired. Serve with dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.
In a large skillet with a tight-fitting lid, heat oil over medium high heat. Add chicken, and brown quickly. Remove chicken from pan.  Reduce heat to medium low, and add garlic, onion and potato to the pan; saute for 2 to 3 minutes. Season with cumin, coriander, black pepper, red pepper and salt. Do not let garlic brown. Mix in water and browned chicken, and any accumulated juices. Place lid on skillet and simmer, stirring occasionally, for 10 to 15 minutes. Remove lid, and stir in the peanut butter and garbanzo beans. Make sure the peanut butter is blended in. Replace lid to simmer for 10 more minutes, or until chicken is cooked through and potatoes are tender. Remove from heat, adjust seasoning, and serve. This delicious stew is inspired by my friend from Sierra Leone, West Africa, who cooks often for her family. Many ingredients can be modified. This is kind of a 'whatever is handy now' recipe. You can use a whole roasting chicken cut into bite-sized pieces, or just breasts and thighs if you prefer.  Other suggested additions are turnips, carrots and celery. This looks great served over white rice with a garnish of fresh chopped cilantro, parsley or unsalted peanuts.

Turn oven temperature up to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Peel beet with a sharp paring knife; peel skin from beet. Cut beet in half and cut halves into thick half-moon-shaped slices. Drizzle walnut oil in a baking dish and brush oil over the bottom of the dish; arrange beet slices in the dish in a single layer. Crumble goat cheese into the empty spaces and over beets. Sprinkle with kosher salt and black pepper. Bake beet and cheese in oven until beet pieces are sizzling and the edges of the cheese are slightly browned, about 15 minutes. Cool slightly, about 10 minutes. Drizzle warm beet and cheese with vinegar and top with roasted walnuts, beet greens, and chives. Serve warm. Beautiful, sweet, twice-roasted beets and baked goat cheese with crunchy nuts and slightly bitter greens is my idea of an easy, healthy, beautiful fall lunch! Or dinner, or breakfast, or brunch. Serve with toasted walnut bread.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil.  Meanwhile, shell the favas and discard the pods.  Boil the favas for 4 minutes, strain and then immediately plunge into ice water.  Let cool for 2 minutes then pierce  the favas and squeeze them out of their skins.  Separate 3/4 of the favas and puree in a food processor. In a separate large saucepan bring the broth to a simmer, and keep it hot.  Meanwhile, in another large saucepan over medium heat, melt 1.5 tablespoons of the butter and add the onions.  Reduce the heat to low and cook for about 5 minutes; do not brown the onions.  Add the rice and cook, while stirring, for 2 minutes.  Add the wine, increase the heat to medium, and stir constantly.  When the wine has been absorbed, add a little of the hot stock.  Once the stock is absorbed, add a little more; repeat this process, stirring constantly, until the rice is cooked through. To the cooked rice add the pureed favas, the remaining 1.5 tablespoons of butter, the rest of the favas and the cheese.  Cook over medium heat, stirring, until the butter and cheese melt and the puree is incorporated evenly.  Season with salt. I can't stress enough how much better this is if it is stirred constantly. If one arm gets tired, switch arms. Taste the rice for doneness before serving. Nothing worse than a plate of crunchy risotto. Try it, and you will find it is well worth it!

Stuff the sausage mixture into the casings and twist off in 3 inch lengths. If you do not have a stuffer, the sausage can be formed into patties or rolled into logs. Refrigerate and use up in one week or freeze for up to 6 weeks. This sausage is typical of the homemade sausages found in the northern area of Italy, especially in Tuscany near the city of Lucca.  They may be used in any recipe calling for Italian sausage. They are versatile in that they can be grilled, fried or boiled.
Preheat oven to 300 degrees F (150 degrees C). Place sausage links onto a sheet pan and bake for 25 minutes, or until done. Cut links in half lengthwise, then cut at an angle into 1/2-inch slices.

Place bacon, split peas, hash brown potatoes, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, black pepper, red pepper flakes, and chicken broth in a slow cooker; stir to combine. Cook on Low for 8 hours (or High for 6 hours). I use bacon instead of ham and frozen hash brown potatoes in this pea soup. It's a good winter comfort food and  smells wonderful while cooking. It freezes well, so when my husband and I  are busy all day, its a quick dinner for us.  I add a sprinkle of red pepper flakes to spice it up a bit. You can also cook whole bacon strips in the microwave until lightly browned. Transfer to paper towels and let cool; crush or tear into small pieces.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with cooking spray.

Beat 2 eggs in a shallow bowl, and place the cornmeal on a plate. Scoop up about 1/4 cup of the tuna mixture, and gently form it into a compact patty. Dip both sides of each cake into beaten egg and then press into cornmeal, and place the cakes onto the prepared baking sheet. Spray the tops of the cakes with cooking oil spray. Bake in the preheated oven until the tops of the cakes are beginning to brown, about 20 minutes. Flip each cake, spray with cooking spray, and bake until the cakes are cooked through and lightly browned, about 20 more minutes. A delicious alternative to the original.

Bake for 10 to 15 minutes in the preheated oven, until firm. Cool on wire racks. Crisp little rounds with the distinctive flavor of anise. These are terrific when glazed or frosted. If you do not like anise, vanilla extract can be substituted for it.
In the mixing bowl of an electric mixer, stir together 1/2 cup warm water, 1 tablespoon sugar, 1/4 cup bread flour, and yeast.  Let grow for about 5 minutes.  It will bubble almost immediately. Measure oats, 4 1/2 cups warm water, whole wheat flour, salt, 2/3 cup sugar, and 2/3 cup oil into the mixing bowl.  Mix on low speed with a dough hook for 1 to 2 minutes. Increase speed slightly, and begin adding bread flour 1/2 to 1 cup at a time until dough pulls away from sides of bowl.  Humidity determines how much flour you need before the bread pulls away from the edge of the bowl.  It is normal for the dough to be sticky. Place dough in an oiled bowl, and turn to coat the surface.  Cover with a damp cloth.  Let rise in a warm spot for 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Divide dough into 6  pieces.  Shape loaves, and place in greased 8 x 4 inch pans.  Let rise until dough is 1 inch above rim of pans, usually 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F ( 175 degrees C) for 35 minutes, or until tops are browned.  Let cool in pans for 10 minutes, and then turn out onto wire racks to cool completely. Best Homemade Bread - 6 loaves in less than 3 hours!  This is a variation of my mother Elaine's recipe.  She is 75, and still makes hers by hand.  I cheat and use a Bosch mixer, that's my time saver.

You'll have a delicious dinner in just 40 minutes.
Preheat grill for medium heat. For each packet, measure out 2 or 3 squares of aluminum foil large enough to easily wrap the vegetables, and layer one on top of the other. Place some of the potatoes and onion in the center, sprinkle with salt and pepper, and dot with butter. Wrap into a flattened square, and seal the edges. Repeat with remaining potatoes and onion. Place aluminum wrapped package over indirect heat, and cover. Cook for approximately 30 minutes, turning once. Serve hot off the grill. Always cook up a package of potatoes and onions with the rest of your grilled meal! Start early, because it takes about a half an hour to cook. These cook over indirect heat (off to the side), so you can grill other things at the same time.

Refrigerate until flavors blend, at least 30 minutes. This recipe uses cultured coconut milk as a substitution for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a dill-flavored, creamy salad dressing. Enjoy! I found an alternative to dairy-based yogurt. Cultured coconut milk is not as thick as yogurt, but it works as a sub for buttermilk and mayonnaise in a traditional ranch-style salad dressing or dip. It's not a perfect sub, but for anyone who is avoiding dairy, it's worth a try. Look for this product in the yogurt section of your grocer. It's also great in smoothies!

Soak the salmon fillet in a brine solution for at least 4 hours, but preferably overnight. Also, submerge the alder wood plank in water, placing a heavy object on top of it to prevent floating. Preheat an outdoor smoker for 160 to 180 degrees F (70 to 80 degrees C). Remove the salmon from the brine, rinse thoroughly under cold running water, and pat dry with paper towels. Remove the wood plank from the water, and lay the fish out on the plank. Season with freshly ground black pepper. Smoke the salmon for at least 2 hours, checking after 1 1/2 hours for doneness. The fish is done when it flakes with a fork, but it should also not be too salty. As the fish smokes, the salt content reduces. Adjust the cooking time and salty flavor to your taste. (Note: Smoking a fillet can take 2 to 6 hours depending on your taste, the size of the fillet, and the fat content of the fish.) During the last 30 minutes of smoking, mix together the brown sugar and water to form a paste. Brush this liberally onto the salmon. This smoked salmon derives its flavor from Alder wood planks. I get these planks at the local lumber yard. Be sure you tell whoever helps you that you are cooking salmon on the wood so that you do not get any creosote wood or other treated wood. Also, make sure you know what plank size will fit in your smoker before you go to get the wood. This salmon will come out very moist and smoky, so be prepared for some of the best smoked fish you've ever eaten!

Bring to a boil and steam until beans are tender but still bright green, about 5 minutes. Drain and toss with the mushrooms. Set aside. Melt the butter in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the onion and parsley; cook and stir until onion is tender. Whisk in flour until blended, then mix in the lemon zest, salt, and pepper. Gradually whisk in milk, stirring constantly, so that no lumps form and then stir in sour cream. Warm over medium heat until the sauce begins to bubble. Dump in the green beans and mushrooms, stirring to coat. Remove from the heat and toss briefly with some of the Cheddar cheese and French fried onions, saving some of each to sprinkle over the top. Spoon into a 1 1/2 quart casserole dish and top with the reserved onions and cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese melts, about 15 minutes. No cans here! Fresh mushrooms, onion, and herbs with frozen green beans, sour cream, and cheddar cheese make this a delightfully tasty twist on the traditional casserole. I developed this recipe, longing for a 'no cans' version of the classic dish. I made this one year for my husband's family at Christmas time, and now they ask for it every year! My husband asks me to make it for dinner throughout the year.
Arrange the grapefruit sections and avocado slices attractively in a shallow serving dish. In a bowl, whisk together the orange juice, olive oil, lime juice, and honey until well combined; drizzle the dressing over the grapefruit and avocado slices.

Heat olive oil in a large saucepan over medium-high heat.  Stir in the onion and green pepper; cook until the onion begins to turn brown, about 5 minutes.  Pour in the water, white beans, tomato sauce, garlic, cilantro, and calabaza.  Season with the sazon packet, bouillon cube, salt, pepper, and cumin; stir well to combine. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to a simmer, cover, and cook until the calabaza has softened, about 20 minutes.  Remove the cover, and continue cooking until the sauce has thickened, about 10 more minutes. A wonderful combination of Caribbean ingredients turn into a very flavorful meal! Pour the beans over white rice or have as a soup. Great with breaded thin steaks. I get requests for this meal from all my family, friends, and coworkers.
In a medium saucepan, melt butter or margarine. Add flour and salt; stir until smooth. Stir in brown sugar. Blend thoroughly and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until mixture bubbles and is lightly browned, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat. Stir in  boiling water. Return to heat and bring to a boil, stirring constantly, until smooth and thickened.  Add vanilla extract and stir until well blended. Serve hot. This sauce is a wonderful concoction that complements bread pudding, cheesecake, or pancakes on Sundays. The taste of brown sugar in a sauce form is irresistible.
Rinse dried beef in warm water, pat dry with paper towels, and slice into smaller pieces. Mix beef, green onions, cream cheese, sour cream, and ranch dressing mix in a bowl. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate 8 hours to overnight. This is an easy cold dip that my husband begs me to make every holiday. I originally got the recipe from my mother-in-law, and I substituted chives for the green onion since I am allergic to onions. They can be added back into the recipe if desired. I serve this with celery sticks, baby carrots, sliced peppers, and crackers.
Mix 1/2 cup lukewarm water and yeast together in a bowl. Let stand until yeast softens and begins to form a creamy foam, about 5 minutes. Combine 1/2 cup water, olive oil, honey, and salt in a separate bowl; add 1 cup flour and mix well. Mix yeast mixture into flour mixture. Add remaining flour, 1 cup at a time, until dough is well combined. Knead dough on a floured work surface until dough is soft, smooth, and elastic, about 8 minutes. Roll dough into 4 calzone shapes. Ready in a snap and my kids love it! This can be used for pizza dough too. My dear chef friend Darrin Gleason shared this recipe with me over ten years ago while attending college. It has been a go-to recipe for my family for all these years and I thought I should share it with my cooking community.
Melt butter in a saucepan over medium heat. Saute the onion in butter until soft. Stir in the vinegar, brown sugar, lemon juice, mustard, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, tomato sauce, and tomato paste. Stir to blend. When the mixture begins to simmer, add the raw ground beef breaking it into pieces with a wooden spoon. Simmer for 20 to 30 minutes. Serve over steamed hot dogs. Of course you can add some raw onions if you want. This is a Meat Sauce from Upstate New York that is used on top of Hot Dogs.  When I grew up it was used on steamed hot dogs and steamed rolls, sometimes with raw onions (for those who like them) on top!  Very good... thanks Grandma Slattery for getting the recipe!
Place the peach, mango, soy milk, and orange juice into a blender. Cover, and puree until smooth. Pour into glasses to serve. You can use fresh or frozen fruit in this yummy smoothie. It tastes better if the fruit is frozen, so I freeze fresh fruit for this.
Blend jalapeno pepper, habanero pepper, garlic, vegetable oil, sherry vinegar, mayonnaise, and 2 teaspoons salt together in a blender until marinade is smooth. Place halved hens in a large bowl. Pour marinade over the chickens and turn to coat completely. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and marinate in the refrigerator for 3 hours. Preheat an outdoor grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Remove hens from marinade, shaking off any excess, place hens on a plate, skin-side up. Discard remaining marinade. Season skin-side of hens with salt. Cook hens on the preheated grill, turning occasionally, until skin is crisped, meat is no longer pink at the bone, and juices run clear, about 45 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). The idea for these grilled game hens is borrowed from my highly successful Cornell chicken experiments, and uses a similar acid/salt/oil/egg concoction. This time the part of egg is played by mayo. Needless to say, you can season this a million ways and use any combination of hot chilies, but the little kick the habanero adds is really nice.
Preheat the oven to 350 degree F (175 degree C). In a medium bowl, mix together the sugar and flour until flour is blended in. Stir in the eggs, corn syrup and vanilla. Mix in the pecans and pour the filling into the pie crust. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes in the preheated oven, until a knife inserted halfway between center and edge comes out clean. Cool. Down-home Texas pecan pie that's not overly sweet.  Easy to make, and great served warm with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a few lines of chocolate syrup.
Preheat oven to 350 degree F (175 degrees C).  Coat a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan with vegetable cooking spray. Combine flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar in a bowl.  Add the peanut butter, and mix in with a pastry blender.  Add milk to beaten egg, and pour this mixture into the flour mixture.  Stir until thoroughly combined; do not beat.  Spread batter into prepared pan. Bake for 50 to 55 minutes.  Cool before slicing. Never enough peanut butter?  Try this bread for your next peanut butter and jelly sandwich.
Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Whisk olive oil, basil, thyme, salt, and pepper together in a bowl. Allow flavors to combine for 5 minutes. Brush oil mixture on inside flesh of peach halves. Grill peaches, flesh sides down until softened and grill marks appear, about 4 minutes. Grilled peaches are given a slightly savory treatment to make them an excellent summertime side dish.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Lightly grease two 9x5 inch loaf pans. In a large bowl, cream together the margarine and sugar until light and fluffy. Stir in the eggs one at a time, beating well with each addition. In a separate bowl, sift together flour, salt and baking powder. In a third bowl, combine the buttermilk, baking soda, vanilla extract and maraschino cherry juice. Stir the milk mixture and flour mixture alternately into the egg mixture until a soft batter is formed. Fold in cherries, chocolate chips, dates, coconut and pecans. Pour batter into prepared pans. Bake in preheated oven for 90 to 120 minutes, until loaves are firm and a toothpick inserted into the center of each loaf comes out clean. Great for gifts. Make ahead and freeze for later.  Rich and tasty!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Beat butter and almond butter in a large mixing bowl with an electric mixer on medium-high speed until creamy, about 30 seconds. Beat in 1/2 cup sugar, brown sugar, baking soda, cream of tartar, and salt until thoroughly combined. Beat egg, milk, and vanilla extract into moist ingredients. Beat whole wheat flour and as much of the all-purpose flour as the mixer can handle; stir remaining flour into dough. Combine 3 tablespoons sugar with ground almonds in a shallow bowl. Pinch off dough and roll into 1-inch balls; roll balls in almond-sugar mixture. Place cookies 2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake in the preheated oven until edges are firm and tops are cracked, 8 to 10 minutes. Immediately press a chocolate almond kiss into middle of each cookie; let cool. This is a New Year's Eve tradition for my husband and I. It's an absolutely delicious new twist to the traditional peanut butter cookies, though they look almost exactly the same.
In a large heavy skillet, heat oil over medium-high heat. Brown pork in oil. Drain off excess fat. Place pork, onion, mushrooms, tomato sauce, brown sugar, vinegar, salt and Worcestershire sauce in a slow cooker. Cook on High for 4 hours, or on Low for 6 to 8 hours. This is a great slow cooker recipe given to me by my Mom. While not strictly authentic, it does have a great sweet and sour taste that goes so well with pork. Serve over cooked white rice. My kids all love it!!! Recipe can be doubled, and it freezes well.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spread pie filling in an 8x8 inch baking dish.  Sprinkle with cinnamon and nutmeg. Cream together margarine and sugar.

Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the center comes out clean, about 40 minutes. Chewy, fudge-y, rich brownies without eggs or oil! Serve warm with whipped cream or ice cream.
Whisk almond flour, water, eggs, maple syrup, and salt together in a bowl until batter is smooth. Heat oil in a skillet over medium heat; drop batter by large spoonfuls onto the griddle, and cook until bubbles form and the edges are dry, 3 to 5 minutes. Flip, and cook until browned on the other side, 3 to 5 minutes. Repeat with remaining batter. These pancakes are a wonderful substitute for regular pancakes when you are watching your carbs! They are very filling and are on the dense side. This is a basic recipe can be tweaked. Any sweetener can be substituted for the maple syrup. Enjoy!
Mix together the cherry pie filling, condensed milk, oranges, pineapple, coconut, marshmallows and whipped topping. Chill for several hours and top with crushed pecans if desired. This salad has been a required dish at Thanksgiving and Xmas for over 25 years at our house. It is our absolute favorite and so easy to fix! Enjoy!
Combine the softened cream cheese, sour cream and taco seasoning on a large plate or in a pie plate.  Spread the salsa on top of the cream cheese-sour cream mixture.  Top with lettuce and cheddar cheese. This dip is great with nacho chips, and you can make it hotter or milder depending on the type of salsa you use.
Drain the beans, but reserve about 1/4 cup of the liquid. Set the beans and reserved liquid aside. Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat, and cook the onion until transparent and beginning to turn brown, about 8 minutes; stir in garlic, and cook just until fragrant, about 1 more minute.

Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Stir blackberries, 2 tablespoons sugar, and vanilla extract together in a bowl; let rest, 15 to 20 minutes. Whisk flour, 3/4 cup sugar, almond meal, baking powder, salt, and cinnamon together in a bowl. Stir milk into flour mixture until batter is just combined. Melt 6 tablespoons butter in a skillet over medium-high heat; pour into the bottom of a 8x12-inch baking dish. Pour batter over melted butter into the baking dish, using a spatula to gently distribute batter without mixing it into the butter, leaving a 1-inch butter border around the sides of the dish. Scatter blackberries over the batter and spoon any accumulated blackberry juices over the top. Bake buckle in the preheated oven until crisped and browned around the edges, about 1 hour. Melt remaining butter in a small skillet over medium-high heat. Cook and stir almonds in hot butter until golden brown and toasted, 2 to 3 minutes. Sprinkle toasted almonds over blackberry buckle and cool buckle to room temperature. This type of rustic dessert is called a buckle because the fruit sinks into the buttery batter as it bakes and 'buckles' the surface with its juicy weight. I was going to tell you to use any berry you want, but I changed my mind. This really needs to be done with blackberries. I added a handful of almond meal, since I had it around, and I think almonds and blackberries have a thing for one another.
Heat the vegetable oil in a wok over medium-high heat; cook and stir the garlic until lightly browned, about 2 minutes. Pour in the soy sauce, rice vinegar, chili sauce, and honey, stir to mix, and bring the mixture to a simmer. Reduce heat to medium-low, and let the sauce simmer for 10 minutes.

Toss all ingredients together. Pack in antioxidants. The ultimate in simplicity and refreshing taste, this coleslaw is flecked with green, red and yellow vegetables, the colors signifying the presence of antioxidants (cabbage is thought to have anti-cancer activity). I like its crispy, sweet-and-sour taste, unlike that of a creamy coleslaw.

Reduce heat, cover skillet, and cook until fish flakes easily with a fork and zucchini is tender, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle mozzarella cheese over fish; cover skillet until cheese melts, about 2 minutes. I got this recipe from a friend and made a few changes to fit our taste. My husband is not a fish lover but he said, 'this is pretty darn good for fish'. From him that is a rave review!

Cook on High, stirring occasionally until the cheese has melted and the dip is hot, 1 to 2 hours. Stir in the black beans, and cook 15 more minutes to reheat. This is my jazzed up version of classic queso dip taken to a heartier level, perfect for football games, tailgating or for taking along to pot lucks in a slow cooker! This is a serious crowd-pleaser that is served hot as a dip, spooned over crisp tortilla chips nacho-style, or rolled up in a warm flour tortilla! The heat can be turned up or down with the addition of jalapenos to taste.
Dissolve 3 teaspoons chicken bouillon in 3 1/2 cups water in a rice cooker. Stir rice, baby bok choy, green onions, carrot, and mushrooms into the bouillon and water mixture. Start rice cooker and cook until liquid is absorbed and rice is tender, about 50 minutes. Dissolve 1 teaspoon chicken bouillon and  1/4 cup water in a small bowl; transfer mixture to a blender. Scoop about 1 cup of the rice mixture into the blender with the bouillon mixture; process until mixture becomes a thin paste, adding more water as needed. Mix the rice paste with the remaining cooked vegetables and rice until thoroughly combined. Season with black pepper. This works with any veggies that are about to go bad and you need to get rid of. The ingredients are basic and the recipe is easy to make since you can do it in the rice cooker. My husband and I were very impressed with how good this turned out, especially since I hardly did any work at all!
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil, and spray with non-stick cooking spray. Coat a small saucepan with non-stick cooking spray.

Bake in preheated oven for 10 to 14 minutes, or until flesh flakes easily with a fork. Brush fillets with remaining glaze, and season with salt and pepper. Use a spatula to transfer fillets to serving platter, leaving the skin behind on the foil. A glaze featuring balsamic vinegar, garlic, honey, white wine and Dijon mustard makes baked salmon fillets extraordinary.
Heat a large dry skillet over medium to medium-high heat. Add the semolina, and toast, stirring constantly. Stir in the sugar and cardamom while toasting until light brown and fragrant, about 10 minutes. Heat a small amount of the ghee in a separate skillet over medium heat. Add the cashews, and cook until lightly toasted, about 10 minutes. Add the cashews to the semolina along with the remaining ghee. Gradually stir hot milk into the semolina until it is thick enough to pack into a ball. Remove from heat, and form palm-sized balls. Let cool and serve. This is a popular Indian dessert recipe that I got from my Indian coworker's wife.  It is VERY sweet, so if you don't like overly sweet desserts, you might want to adjust the semolina/sugar ratio accordingly.
Melt butter in a small saucepan over medium-low heat; stir maple syrup, curry powder, and ground mustard into butter until smooth. Pour 1/4 cup ginger ale into butter mixture.

Meanwhile bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add the spaghetti, and cook for 7 minutes, or until tender. After the first 2 minutes, add the asparagus spears they will be done at the same time. As you wait for the pasta, heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and mushrooms; cook and stir for a few minutes, then add the garlic. Cook until garlic is fragrant, then add the wine. Cook and stir to remove any bits stuck to the pan, then reduce the heat to low and stir in the cream. Drain the spaghetti and asparagus, and mix into the skillet with the cream sauce. Flake the salmon and mix it in too. Pour onto a serving dish, and place the prawns on top. Garnish with grated Parmesan cheese, and serve. This is a lovely salmon spaghetti dish made with red wine, cream and garlic. It tastes like it came from a restaurant but it's really simple and tastes stunning.
Melt the butter or margarine over low heat.  Mix together in a large bowl 2-1/2 cups of the flour. Add sugar, baking powder, lemon rind and salt.  Make a depression in the middle.

Fold in the cilantro, olives, and remaining olive oil until blended. Cover, and refrigerate until cold. Stir before serving. A great chilled whole-grain salad to serve with grilled chicken, or on its own for lunch. Can be improved with a combination of whole grains, but the barley works on its own.
Grease a baking sheet. Cut off 1/4 of the dough from 1 loaf and form into a pear-shaped ball for the bunny head. Form the remaining 3/4 loaf into a fat oval shape for the body. Place the body onto the prepared baking sheet and attach the head by pinching the 2 pieces together. Make narrow cuts, about 3/4 in deep, on each side of head for whiskers. Cut second loaf of dough into 4 equal pieces. Roll 2 pieces into 16-inch ropes. Fold each rope in half, and pinch the ends to the head to form ears. Cut the third piece of dough in half and shape into 2 ovals about 3 1/2 inches long for back paws. Attach the paws to the bottom sides of the body. Make two 1-inch cuts on the paws for toes. Cut the remaining dough into 3 pieces. Form 2 pieces into balls and pinch on sides for front paws. Divide the remaining piece of dough into 3 equal pieces and roll into 1-inch balls. Press the dough balls onto the  the face to form two cheeks and a nose. Press raisins onto the face to make eyes. Press almond slices close together onto face to make bunny teeth.

Asparagus spears are dipped in an egg white-mayonnaise mixture, then coated in Parmesan and panko breadcrumbs before a trip to the oven to bake into a crunchy, delicious side dish. Very easy and delicious!
Place pinto beans into a large pot and pour in enough water to cover by 2 to 3 inches. Let beans soak overnight. Drain beans, return to pot, and pour in fresh water to cover; add diced tomatoes, bacon, onion, chili powder, cumin, and garlic powder. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to low, and simmer for 3 hours. Stir cilantro and salt into bean mixture; simmer until beans are soft, about 1 more hour. Pinto beans are simmered with onion, tomatoes, chili powder, cumin and garlic. I love making these beans just because they make the whole house smell so good, and the longer they simmer the better they taste. You could add 1/2 can of beer to make 'borracho' beans. I personally taste-test throughout the entire cooking process and add extra seasoning as I feel it needs it. These beans could simmer all day long; just make sure they have plenty of water to keep the beans covered.
In a large bowl, cut cold butter or margarine into flour until the mixture has a crumb-like texture. Make a well in the center, add cold water. Mix together until the mixture forms a ball.

In a large bowl combine the yeast, sugar, 1 teaspoon of the salt and 1 1/2 cups of the flour. In a sauce pan combine the milk, water and 1/4 cup of the butter or margarine until 110 degrees F (38 degrees C). Add milk mixture and vinegar to the flour mixture and blend at low speed of the mixer until moistened. Beat at medium speed for 3 minutes. Stir in 1 1/2 cups additional flour to form a sticky dough. Turn dough out onto a floured surface and knead adding 1/2  to 1 cup more of flour until dough is smooth and pliable. Place dough in a greased bowl and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume. Punch down dough and roll into a rectangle shape about 16x8 inches. In a saucepan heat the onion, garlic, 1/2 teaspoon salt, parsley and 2 tablespoons butter or margarine until butter or margarine is melted. Spread over the dough rectangle and starting from the 16 inch side roll the dough up tightly like a jelly roll. Place the bread seam side down onto a greased cookie sheet and let rise until doubled in sized. Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (205 degrees C). Bake bread until golden brown about 20 to 30 minutes. Brush hot bread with melted butter and sprinkle with chopped parsley. Crusty, chewy bread  ribboned with a savory filling. This is an authentic French recipe.

Bake in the preheated oven for 40 minutes. Remove aluminum foil and continue baking until bacon is crisp and chicken breasts are no longer pink in the center and the juices run clear, about 20 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). This is a nice spin on traditional baked chicken and apples - bacon makes it that much better! This recipe can be easily adapted for the fall fruits or veggies you have on hand, and is delicious served with mashed sweet potatoes.
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Saute the white parts of the green onions with the jalapenos for 5 minutes; do not brown. Stir in the sherry, rice, salt and pepper.  Pour in the broth and water; bring to a boil.  Cover, reduce heat to low, and cook until rice is tender and liquid is absorbed, about 20 minutes. Fluff with a fork and stir in cilantro, parsley and tops of green onions.  Transfer to a warm serving dish and serve immediately. I have changed this recipe off and on during the years, but generally it has remained the same wonderful dish. Add red bell pepper for additional color if you wish!
Add carrots to a pot of lightly salted water, and bring to a low boil. Simmer until carrots are tender. Drain. Put melted butter in a bowl, and stir in apricot preserves. Stir in nutmeg, salt, orange zest, and lemon juice. Add carrots, and stir well to coat. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. Carrots are cooked tender then mixed with a tangy apricot sauce.

Preheat an oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Place the okra and tomatoes in a bowl. Pour in the olive oil and sprinkle with kosher salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Stir until the vegetables are coated with oil. Add the panko bread crumbs and stir. Spread the vegetables on to a lightly greased baking sheet. Bake for 13 to 15 minutes until the tomatoes are soft and the okra is lightly browned. Roasting the okra with tomatoes keeps it from being slimy, and a dusting of panko adds a touch of crunch to mimick fried okra without the added fat from frying.
Heat oil in a large, deep saute pan over medium-high heat. Add onion and bell pepper; cook until soft and golden, about 5 minutes.  Add garlic and chili powder; continue to cook until fragrant, 1 to 2 minutes longer. Add tomatoes, broth and hominy; bring to simmer. Reduce heat to low and simmer, partially covered, about 10 minutes, to blend flavors. Add turkey, salt and pepper. Simmer until heated through, about 5 minutes. Stir in cilantro.

In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, whole wheat flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, salt, cinnamon, allspice, dry milk powder, wheat bran, and farina cereal until thoroughly combined. Drain water from the raisins. In a separate bowl, beat the egg whites until frothy, then mix in the drained raisins, applesauce, carrot, vegetable oil, and bran cereal. Pour the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture, and briefly mix just to moisten (do not overmix). Fill muffin cups about 2/3 full, and sprinkle each muffin with about 1/2 teaspoon of  raw sugar. Bake in the preheated oven until the muffins are set and the tops are golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. A toothpick inserted into the center of a muffin should come out clean. Serve warm. These muffins are delicious.  My very, very picky son loves them for breakfast and doesn't even realize they are full of good things for him.  You can easily substitute the grains in the recipe for whatever you prefer or have on hand.
Place the potatoes in a large pot, and fill with enough lightly salted water to cover. Bring to a boil, and cook until tender, about 10 minutes. Drain, mash with 1/4 cup of butter, and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together the bread, onions, savory, salt and pepper. Stir in the mashed potatoes, while drizzling in the remaining butter. The mixture should become the texture of biscuit dough. Stuff turkey just before roasting. Place any leftover stuffing in a bowl in the refrigerator for later. This is a stuffing that my grandmother used to make every time we had turkey. It's the best in the world. She used to put some in the turkey and some cold in the fridge raw. It tastes good this way as well.
In an oven safe bowl, combine artichoke hearts, chile peppers, pimento peppers, mayonnaise, Monterey Jack cheese and almost all of the Parmesan cheese; sprinkle remaining Parmesan cheese on top.  Refrigerate for 1 hour. Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until lightly browned. This is the best hot artichoke dip ever!

Stir cauliflower, potato, salt, and turmeric into oil until coated completely; cover the skillet with a lid, reduce heat to medium, and cook, stirring every few minutes, until cauliflower and potato are tender, 15 to 20 minutes. Season with sugar and cayenne pepper and cook until flavors develop, about 2 minutes more. A wonderful dish! Not your boring vegetable! I love the cabbage as much as the cauliflower but plan to use a bigger pan, like a Dutch oven, if you are using cabbage instead of cauliflower.
Heat olive oil in a skillet over medium heat; cook and stir garlic until fragrant, about 1 minute. Add chicken and cook until browned, about 4 minutes per side. Pour broth over chicken and cover skillet; lower heat to low and simmer until chicken is no longer pink in the center, about 30 minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). Transfer chicken to a plate, reserving broth mixture in the skillet. Pour lemon juice into broth mixture and simmer until liquid is reduced by 1/3, 2 to 3 minutes. Return chicken to the skillet and cook until heated through, 2 to 3 minutes per side. Not a lot to say here--very few ingredients, not a lot of calories, and delicious.

Remove to a plate and repeat with remaining bread slices. Sift confectioners' sugar over top of the French toast, slice diagonally, and serve. This recipe just came to me this morning, simple but very aromatic, a very sweet-style French toast.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly spray a 12-inch round pizza pan with butter-flavored cooking spray. Combine flour and confectioners' sugar in a bowl. Cut in butter with a knife or pastry blender until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Press into prepared pizza pan to make a crust. Bake in preheated oven until very lightly browned, 12 to 15 minutes. Cool on a wire rack. Beat cream cheese, 1/3 cup white sugar, and almond extract until smooth; spread over completely cooled crust. Arrange strawberries, blueberries, and kiwi decoratively over cream cheese mixture. Mix pineapple juice, 1/2 cup white sugar, cornstarch, and lemon juice in a saucepan until smooth; bring to a boil. Cook and stir until thickened, about 2 minutes. Cool slightly and drizzle over fruit. Refrigerate until chilled. Almond extract makes all the difference in this updated version of the traditional fruit pizza. Kiwi makes the topping completely fresh and adds beautiful color. Use low-fat cream cheese for a slightly lighter version. Any clear juice (apple, pear, peach, etc.) may be substituted for the pineapple.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Whisk olive oil, 3 tablespoons balsamic vinegar, honey, paprika, garlic, salt, and black pepper together in a large bowl. Stir potatoes, mushrooms, and sweet onion into vinegar mixture; toss to coat. Spread vegetables over prepared baking sheet. Bake in preheated oven until potatoes are easily pierced with a fork, 30 to 40 minutes.

Drain the bacon slices on a paper towel-lined plate; crumble bacon. Transfer potato mixture to a large bowl and toss with bacon, green onions, parsley, and remaining 2 tablespoons balsamic vinegar. Super easy, delicious and reheats well! This (loosely inspired by German potato salad) recipe is tasty hot or cold and great for outdoor dining - no mayo to worry about keeping cold. Also, you can switch it up and play with different flavor combinations by swapping the vinegar, herbs, and spices. Enjoy!
Heat olive oil in a large, heavy pot over medium heat. Cook and stir onion and garlic in hot oil until tender, 5 to 7 minutes. Stir crushed tomatoes, tomato sauce, tomato paste, and water with the onion mixture until smooth; add sugar, parsley, basil, salt, Italian seasoning, fennel, and pepper. Stir the mixture, bring to a simmer, reduce heat to low, and cook, stirring occasionally, until thickened and the seasonings have permeated the sauce, 1 hour to 90 minutes. I've used this sauce for lasagna, ziti, eggplant Parmesan, meatballs, and spaghetti. You name it, it's great with it.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch fluted tube pan (such as a Bundt(R)).

Bake in preheated oven until top of cake springs back when lightly pressed and a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 50 minutes. Cool cake in the pan for 15 minutes before removing cake to finish cooling on rack. Mix confectioners' sugar, 1/4 cup peach nectar, lemon juice, and lemon peel in a bowl to make a smooth frosting. Place cake on a serving platter; poke holes in top of the cake with a fork. Pour frosting slowly over the cake, allowing frosting to soak into the holes and drizzle down the sides of the cake. This is the BEST cake I have ever had, hands down! My Memaw used to make this for holidays from Easter to Christmas. It is a family favorite! Easy to make and delicious!

Easy to make but hard to resist, this pie's got a layer of nutty caramel, one of eggnog and pudding, and a whipped topping on a graham cracker crust.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lay out 4 squares of aluminum foil. Place one cube steak onto each piece of foil. Spread margarine over the steaks, and season with salt and pepper. Layer one sliced potato over each steak, and a few rings of onion. Season again with salt and pepper if you like. Fold the foil around the food, and seal into a packet. Place packets onto a baking sheet. Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, until the beef is no longer pink, and the potatoes are tender. Open carefully, as hot steam will be released. Cube steak, potatoes and onion all wrapped up in a neat little package. This was a quick fast fix my mom always made for us. Now I make it for my family. It's easy and a meal all in one packet.
Combine curing mixture, sugar, garlic powder, onion powder, mustard seed, ground pepper, red pepper, and liquid smoke in a large bowl.  Mix until evenly blended, and set aside. Slice venison with the grain into strips 3/16-inch thick, and 2-inches wide. Add to curing mixture and gently mix together until every slice is coated with curing mix.  Place into a plastic bag, squeeze out all air, and seal; or place into a glass or plastic bowl and cover.  Refrigerate for at least 18 hours to cure. Turn oven to 150 degrees F (65 degrees C). Spray two wire racks with cooking spray, and place onto cookie sheets. Squeeze excess liquid from the venison, and lay the strips onto the prepared wire racks, making sure the pieces do not touch each other.  Place the jerky into the oven, and cook until dried, 3 to 8 hours, depending on the temperature of your oven. You can tell the meat is done when it no longer bends and you could break off a piece with ease, but the meat should not be so dry as to be crisp and break.  It is better to be less dry than over dried, because you can finish it by letting it air dry to perfection. Do not worry about color changes of the jerky, it will get lighter and harder as it continues to dry over time. Jerky can be frozen or kept in sealed containers in the refrigerator.

Add the burgers and cook until they're well browned on both sides. Pour off any fat. Add the remaining soup, Worcestershire, water and mushrooms to the skillet and heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to low. Cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the burgers are cooked through. There's nothing more satisfying and delicious than these tasty, quick-cooking, beef burgers served with a creamy mushroom gravy.
In a large bowl, stir together the flour, sugar and custard powder. Mix in the soy milk with a whisk so there are no lumps. Heat a griddle over medium heat, and coat with nonstick cooking spray. Spoon batter onto the surface, and cook until bubbles begin to form on the surface. Flip with a spatula and cook on the other side until golden. This vegan pancake recipe is the best of the vegan lot. The secret that these pancakes are not soggy like the other vegans ones is that it uses custard powder. This ensures the pancakes are cakelike and taste and look exactly like non-vegan pancakes. Mix fruit into the batter if you like. Serve hot with syrup or jam.
Cover a large flat surface with waxed paper.  In a large bowl, stir together the popcorn, cereal, corn chips, almonds, and pretzels. Melt the confectioners' coating in a glass bowl in the microwave for 1 minute. Continue to cook at 30 second intervals, stirring between each one, until the coating is smooth. Pour melted coating over the cereal mixture. It's best to use a large metal spoon, and pour 1 or 2 spoonfuls at a time then mix to ensure even distribution. (A second person can be useful here - one to pour, one to mix.) Once everything is coated, spread the mixture out onto waxed paper in a thin layer. Let stand for about 1/2 hour, or until coating is dry. Transfer to a bowl to serve, or store in an airtight container. This is an easy and extremely tasty recipe! Every time I make this, I have people lined up to get the recipe! Cereal, corn chips, pretzels and nuts are coated with a vanilla confectioner's coating (also known as almond bark). This recipe makes a LOT--enough to fill an entire punch bowl and then some! Great for get-togethers.

Stir flour into melted butter; cook, stirring continually, until beginning to brown, about 5 minutes. Slowly stir beer into the butter mixture. Add Mexican cheese blend and white Cheddar cheese in small amounts, stirring continually, allowing each addition to melt into the beer mixture before adding the next. Stir beef into the cheesy mixture. My yummy taco queso dip is always a favorite and super easy to make gluten-free! Serve with tortilla chips.
Prepare an outdoor grill for indirect medium-high heat. Rinse turkey and pat dry. Turn wings back to hold neck skin in place. Return legs to tucked position. Brush turkey with oil. Season inside and out with Italian seasonings, salt, and pepper. Place turkey, breast side up, on a metal grate inside a large roasting pan. Arrange pan on the prepared grill. Grill 2 to 3 hours, to an internal thigh temperature of 180 degrees F (85 degrees C). Remove turkey from grill and let stand 15 minutes before carving. Although not very traditional, grilling turkey is the best way of cooking it -- it comes out tender and juicy every time! The turkey drippings may be used to prepare a gravy by placing a metal pan under the turkey inside the roasting pan, and mixing in about 1/2 cup water, adding more water as necessary to prevent the drippings from scorching. Remove the pan about 30 minutes before the turkey is done cooking.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Fill an 8x8 inch baking dish with 1 inch of water. Beat the egg, eggnog, and sugar together in a bowl. Pour into two small baking dishes. Sprinkle tops with nutmeg. Place the baking dishes into the dish with the water. Add more water if necessary to reach halfway up the sides of the baking dishes. Bake in preheated oven until tops are set, 35 to 45 minutes. Cool before serving. This is a holiday favorite in my family. The custard is soft and yummy! If you like eggnog you might try this.

Mix in the crushed cookies, and coconut alternately with the milk. Stir in the applesauce. Pour batter into prepared pan. Bake in preheated oven for 1 hour, or until the top springs back when lightly touched. An easy and delicious way to use up old vanilla wafers. Similar to Graham Cracker Cake.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Place a wire rack on top of baking sheet; place bacon strips on wire rack. Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes; remove from oven and sprinkle tops of bacon strips with half the brown sugar. Return to oven and bake 10 more minutes. Remove from oven and flip bacon to other side; sprinkle with remaining brown sugar and bake until bacon is crisp and brown sugar is golden brown, 10 to 15 more minutes. Remove bacon, let cool, and crumble into small pieces. Lightly grease a skillet with vegetable oil and place over medium-high heat. Whisk flour, white sugar, and baking powder in a large bowl; in a separate bowl, whisk beer, melted butter, salt, and vanilla extract. Lightly stir the liquid ingredients into the flour mixture to make a smooth batter. Stir candied bacon pieces into the batter. Pour batter into the hot skillet 1/2 cup at a time and cook until edges are browned, about 2 minutes; flip pancake and cook until golden brown and the center is set, 3 to 5 more minutes.

Whisk peanut oil, vinegar, lemon juice, honey, soy sauce, garlic powder, black pepper, dry mustard, salt, Worcestershire sauce, water, and sesame oil together in a bowl until dressing is smooth. Combine kale, chopped peanuts, Parmesan cheese, dry-roasted peanuts, cilantro, and mint leaves together in a bowl; add dressing and toss to coat. Let salad sit for a few minutes for flavors to blend. Kale is healthy for you but tends to be strong in flavor. This salad with the peanut dressing cuts down the strong taste of kale. Key is not to overly saturate the salad with the dressing. I squeeze out excess dressing.
Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat, and lightly oil the grate. Cut the zucchini in half crosswise, then slice each half into 3 slices lengthwise, making 6 slices per zucchini. Mix the butter, garlic, and parsley in a bowl, and spread the mixture on both sides of each zucchini slice. Sprinkle one side of each slice with Parmesan cheese, and place the slices, cheese sides up, crosswise on the preheated grill to keep them from falling through. Grill the zucchini until the cheese has melted and the slices are cooked through and show grill marks, about 8 minutes. This is a summer favorite at my house. So easy and tasty, and complements steak, ribs, chicken or fish. By the way, these can be done in the oven under the broiler as well.
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Lightly grease one 9x13 inch baking dish. Place a layer of tomatoes in the bottom of the baking dish, followed by a layer of noodles, spinach, carrots, zucchini, summer squash, eggplant and broccoli. Season to taste with oregano, salt and pepper. Repeat layering of ingredients until all are used up. If using cheeses sprinkle over broccoli layers and on top of dish. Bake at 375 degrees F (190 degrees C) for 25 to 35 minutes. A delicious alternative to traditional lasagna. Great for a dinner party, even when entertaining non-vegetarians! For vegans omit the cheeses!

Separate slices from loaf by cutting each slice the rest of the way through the loaf. Dip bread slices in egg mixture to coat completely. Melt butter on a griddle over medium-high heat. Working in batches, cook bread slices on preheated griddle until golden brown, 2 to 5 minutes per side. Serve French toast with strawberry-almond mixture. This makes an elegant looking breakfast or brunch and can be made up the night before then grilled in the morning. I have used fresh strawberries and just blended them to use in making the sauce. Top with whipped cream.
Pour grape and orange soda into a punch bowl. Scoop small portions of lime sherbet into the soda mixture. Let the sherbet melt into a foamy green layer on top. Disgusting-looking punch for children's Halloween parties. Very easy and inexpensive. It is hard to convince kids to drink it, but they love it once they've tried it. It's too sweet for most adults. It helps that we live on a lake and say we've just drawn it from the lake.
Whisk liquid amino acid, lemon juice, and olive oil together in a bowl until smooth; add red onion and alfalfa sprouts and stir to coat.

Cover bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate salad at least 1 hour. I learned how to make this recipe while working at a salad bar grocery store. It was the one item that we had to have to ensure that no riots would start. It is full of delicious super foods and super flavors! Each ingredient should be considered to taste. Some prefer more dressing while others prefer more seeds. Enjoy!

Reduce heat, and simmer uncovered for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, to blend flavors. This is an easy to make departure from your traditional chili.  This recipe calls for pepperoni, mushrooms and a jar of prepared spaghetti sauce.  Every time I make this for others, I am always asked for the recipe.
Combine 1 cup flour, sugar, undissolved yeast and salt in a large mixing bowl. Heat water, milk and butter until very warm (120 to 130 degrees F). Gradually add to dry ingredients; beat 2 minutes at medium speed of electric mixer, scraping bowl occasionally. Add eggs and 1/2 cup flour; beat 2 minutes at high speed, scraping bowl occasionally. Stir in remaining flour to make a stiff batter. Turn into 2 greased 8 or 9-inch square pans. Or, to make muffins, fill 24 greased muffin tins half full. Sprinkle evenly with Sugar-Nut Topping (see directions below). Cover; let rise in warm, draft-free place until doubled in size, about 1 hour. Bake at 350 degrees F for 20 to 25 minutes or until done. Remove from pans; cool on wire racks. Sugar-Nut Topping: Combine butter and brown sugar with a pastry blender or two knives until mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in chopped walnuts. A light, not-too-sweet coffee cake dough is topped with brown sugar and walnuts and baked until golden brown.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10 inch tube pan. In a medium bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, nutmeg, cinnamon and allspice. Set aside. In a large mixing bowl, combine oil and baby food, then add eggs. Add sugar and mix well. Add the flour mixture and mix until well combined. Pour batter into prepared 10 inch tube pan. Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) for 1 hour, or until toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean. Cool for 10 minutes in the pan, then turn out onto a wire rack. Use baby food carrots to easily execute this carrot cake recipe with the proper nutmeg, cinnamon, and allspice seasonings.
Warm a large skillet or wok over medium heat. When the skillet is hot, pour in canola and sesame oils, then place whole green beans into the skillet. Stir the beans to coat with oil. Cook until the beans are bright green and slightly browned in spots, about 10 minutes. Remove from heat, and stir in soy sauce; cover, and let sit about 5 minutes. Transfer to a serving platter, and sprinkle with toasted sesame seeds. I discovered this dish at my mother-in-law's house during a family holiday buffet. Her being Japanese, she had many friends who brought wonderful Japanese dishes, and this was and has remained one of my favorites. It's light and fresh any time of the year.
In a small bowl, stir together the brown sugar, melted butter, and corn syrup. Pour into a greased 9x13 inch baking dish, and spread evenly. Sprinkle pecans over the sugar mixture. Arrange the bread slices in the bottom of the dish so they are in a snug single layer. In a medium bowl, whisk together the orange zest, orange juice, milk, sugar, cinnamon, vanilla, egg whites, and eggs. Pour this mixture over the bread, pressing on the bread slices to help absorb the liquid. Cover and refrigerate for at least one hour, or overnight. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees  F (175 degrees C ). Remove the cover from the baking dish, and let stand for 20 minutes at room temperature. Bake for 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until golden brown. Dust with confectioners' sugar before serving. My husband and I were vacationing recently and had this lovely French toast at a bed and breakfast.  When we came back home, I kept missing it so I called them up and requested it.  They actually gave me the recipe over the phone!  I generally halve the recipe for my husband and I, and bake it in an 8 inch square pan.  Reheats well in the toaster oven.  I served it to my in-laws recently and they loved it. Serve with a little sweetened whipped cream and berries!
Place ground lamb, rice, 1/4 cups olive oil, mint, currants, pine nuts, salt, pepper, cumin, cinnamon, oregano, and egg in a bowl. Mix together thoroughly with a fork. Cover and refrigerate until ready to use. Gently unroll and separate grape leaves. Rinse in cold water to remove brine. Drain. Reserve broken or less-than-perfect leaves to line pot. Place grape leaves on work surface with smooth side down (ribs of leaves up). Place a rounded tablespoon of lamb-rice filling near bottom-center of grape leaf. Fold bottom sections of leaf over mixture, fold over sides, and roll toward the top of the leaf into a firm cylinder. Don't roll too tightly or leaves may burst when rice cooks. Drizzle 1 tablespoon olive oil into pot; line bottom of pot with 1 or 2 layers of reserved grape leaves. Place dolmas in pot by arranging them along the sides then working toward the center to cover the bottom. Leave enough space between dolmas to allow for expansion, but close enough to hold their shapes when cooking. If necessary, make two layers. Pour in lemon juice and 2 teaspoons olive oil. Invert a small plate and then a larger plate over the dolmas to weight them down while they cook. Pour in hot chicken broth. Bring to a simmer, uncovered, over medium-high heat. As soon as liquid is heated through and starting to bubble (2 to 4 minutes), reduce heat to low, cover, and cook 35 minutes. Remove plates and check for doneness. Dolmas should look a bit puffed up, and a fork should pierce them easily. If not quite done, continue cooking without the plates, covered, until rice is tender, 10 to 15 minutes longer. These lamb and rice stuffed grape leaves (dolmas) take some time and effort to put together, so maybe make a double batch. In restaurants these are usually meatless, but I love the lamb in these. No matter what you use, how much rice you use will affect how much liquid you need.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F. Melt shortening over low heat.  Pour into 9 inch baking pan.  Layer bread crumbs evenly in bottom of pan. Layer coconut, chocolate chips, butterscotch chips and nuts over bread crumbs.  Drizzle condensed milk over top. Bake 25 to 30 minutes.  Let cool before cutting into bars. These could be called Coconut Chocolate Butterscotch Nutty Bars!
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease and flour one 9 inch round cake pan. Beat the flour, 1 cup sugar, baking powder, salt, 3/4 cup milk, shortening, 1 egg, and 1 teaspoon vanilla at low speed, scraping bowl constantly for 30 seconds. Beat on high speed, scraping bowl occasionally for 3 minutes. Pour batter into the prepared pan. Bake at 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) for 30 to 35 minutes or until a wooden pick inserted near the center comes out clean. Remove from the pan and let cool on a wire rack. To Make The Cream Filling: In a 2 quart saucepan, mix 1/3 cup of the sugar, the cornstarch and salt. Stir in the milk gradually and cook over medium heat, stirring constantly, until the mixture thickens and boils. Boil and stir 1 minute. Stir at least 1/2 of the mixture slowly into the egg yolks. Return egg yolk mixture to the saucepan and boil and stir for 1 minute. Remove from heat and stir in the 2 teaspoons vanilla. Let cool to room temperature. To Make Chocolate Glaze: Heat the chocolate and butter or margarine over low heat until melted. Remove from the heat and stir in the confectioners' sugar, and vanilla. Stir in the water, one teaspoon at a time, until glaze is of desired consistency. To Assemble the Cake: Split the cooled cake in half to make 2 thin layers. Fill the layers with the filling. Then spread the chocolate glaze over the top. Refrigerate any leftover cake. Yellow cake filled with custard and topped with chocolate icing--yummy!
Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Stir in mushrooms and garlic. Cook until the mushrooms have begun to brown, about 4 minutes. Increase heat to high, and pour in wine. Bring to a boil, then stir in olives, capers, caper juice, crushed tomatoes, and pepper flakes. Return to a simmer, then reduce heat to medium-low, and cook for 20 minutes. Meanwhile, bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add pasta and cook for 8 to 10 minutes or until al dente; drain and toss with sauce to serve. A fantastic variation of a simple but delicious Italian dish, my Puttanesca is a mildly spicy white wine tomato sauce with fresh garlic, mushrooms, capers, and anchovy-stuffed green olives. The anchovy-stuffed green olives are easy to find next to the rest of the canned olives at any major grocery store.
Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Grease a 9x13 inch pan. In a large bowl, cream together shortening, brown sugar, and 1/2 cup white sugar. Beat in the 3 eggs one at a time, then stir in the vanilla. Combine the flour, baking soda, and salt; blend into the sugar mixture. Stir in chocolate chips, and set aside. In a separate bowl, mix together the cream cheese and 1/4 cup white sugar. Mix in the 2 remaining eggs. Spread 1/2 of chocolate chip dough in bottom of the prepared pan. Pour cream cheese batter on top of dough. Sprinkle with pecans. Drop pieces of the remaining chocolate chip batter over filling. Don't worry if there are gaps; the batter will spread. Bake for 45 minutes in preheated oven, or until lightly browned on the top. Let the brownies cool in the pan before cutting into bars. Here's a scrumptious recipe that combines a blonde brownie and cheesecake!
Whisk sour cream, sweetener, apple cider vinegar, and ranch dressing mix in a bowl until thoroughly combined. Toss green apples, shredded cabbage, and green onions in a salad bowl and pour dressing over the slaw; toss to coat. Season with salt and black pepper. Cover bowl with plastic wrap and chill at least 20 minutes or up to 4 hours before serving. Tangy coleslaw with a hint of sweetness. Diced walnuts or slivered almonds can be added just before serving. Add 1/2 teaspoon celery seed if desired.
Mix ground beef, Worcestershire sauce, parsley, basil, brown sugar, black pepper, and garlic salt together in a bowl; form into 10 patties. Cook patties in a skillet, working in batches, until browned and desired doneness is reached, 4 to 5 minutes per side. If you're like me and don't like onions or other vegetables in your burger, try this recipe.
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Cut bread slices into cubes and spread onto a baking sheet. Bake in the preheated oven until cubes are dry and crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Heat 3 tablespoons coconut oil in a skillet over medium heat. Cook and stir onions, celery, and leek in the hot oil until soft, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer vegetables into a bowl and stir gluten-free bread cubes, parsley, sage, marjoram, thyme, rosemary, and 2 tablespoons coconut oil into the vegetables. Moisten dressing with vegetable broth, about 1/2 cup at a time, mixing thoroughly. Transfer into a 9-inch square baking dish and cover with aluminum foil. Bake in the preheated oven for 20 minutes. Uncover and bake until stuffing is heated through and top is lightly golden brown, about 15 more minutes. This stuffing is so tasty, and I can't wait to make it for everyone at Thanksgiving. I did this as a test experiment to see if I could make stuffing that would not make my love miss the bagged wheat-based stuffing. I also wanted it to be so good even our wheat-eating friends wouldn't be able to tell. I think it succeeded! Bake outside the bird or use to stuff a turkey.
Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil over high heat. Once the water is boiling, stir in the macaroni, and return to a boil. Cook the pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until the pasta has cooked through, but is still firm to the bite, about 8 minutes. Drain well in a colander set in the sink. Pour the macaroni into a saucepan and place over medium heat; stir in the butter, bacon grease, tomato sauce, stewed tomatoes with juice, and sugar; season with salt and pepper. Stir while cooking until butter and bacon grease has melted and incorporated completely, 5 to 10 minutes; remove from heat, cover, and allow to sit about 20 minutes before serving. This is a delicious side dish to add to about anything.
Mix snow and sweetened condensed milk together in a bowl until very well mixed. My mom used to tell us that back home they would eat snow with 'thick, sweet milk', which can be easily known as sweetened condensed milk. This recipe is easy and will be leaving you asking for more. Place a large bowl outside when snowing. If there is already a lot of snow, you can pick up the clean, fresh snow.
Mix potatoes, onions, eggs, flour, baking powder, and lemon juice in a large bowl; season with nutmeg, salt, and black pepper. Shape potato mixture into 12 evenly sized patties. Heat vegetable oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Pan-fry potato patties in batches until tender and browned on both sides, 7 to 10 minutes. Transfer browned patties to a paper towel-lined baking sheet. Repeat with remaining patties. Need a tasty side for any meal of the day? These are the route to go. I tried this recipe in my culinary class and they were amazing! Everyone raved about their excellent texture and flavor!
Place steak into a large resealable bag or shallow dish. Pour in the dry vermouth and sweet vermouth and stir to coat the steak. Seal or cover and refrigerate for 6 hours to marinate. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Remove steak from the bag and discard the marinade. Season the steak on both sides with red pepper flakes. Fry for 3 to 4 minutes per side for medium-rare, or to your desired degree of doneness. Let rest for a few minutes before serving. A friend tried something like this in Texas and this was our version of it.
To prepare the marinade, stir together beer, lime juice, olive oil, garlic, brown sugar, Worcestershire sauce, cilantro, cumin, and salt; mix well. To use marinade, pour into a resealable plastic bag, add up to 1 1/2 pounds of chicken breast, and mix until chicken is well coated. Marinate for 1 to 3 hours in the refrigerator. This is a great chicken fajita marinade!
Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Lightly coat the bottom of a 13x9-inch baking dish with cooking spray. Drizzle lime juice over one side of each tilapia fillet; place the fillets with the juiced-side down into the prepared baking dish. Spread a thin layer of yogurt atop each fillet. Mix pecans and coconut in a bowl. Divide equally between the tilapia fillets and lightly press mixture into the yogurt layer. Bake in preheated oven until fish flakes easily with a fork, about 15 minutes. A quick, easy, and super yummy twist on tilapia!
Fill a cocktail shaker with ice. Pour rum, vanilla schnapps, and cream over the ice. Cover, shake, and strain martini into a cocktail glass. This amazing cocktail is an at-home easy adaptation of a drink I love! It tastes like sweet coconut and is a real crowd pleaser for those who don't like the taste of traditional alcoholic drinks.
Muddle simple syrup and mint leaves together in a large glass; add ice. Pour in peach-flavored bourbon liqueur, peach schnapps, club soda, and sweet tea. Stir well. A mint julep with a twist. If you don't have enough room in your glass for 2.5 ounces of sweet tea, just top it off.
Preheat an oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Spray a 9x13 inch baking dish with nonstick cooking spray. Heat olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat.  Cook the onion in the oil until translucent, about 5 minutes.  Stir in the ground buffalo. Cook, breaking up meat with a spoon as it browns, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle the contents of 1 taco seasoning packet over meat and onion; mix well. Combine the remaining packet of taco seasoning mix and the refried beans in a small bowl. Spread seasoned beans in the prepared baking dish. Layer the buffalo and onion mixture, guacamole, and sour cream over the beans. Top with the black olives, green onions, jalapenos, and the shredded Cheddar cheese. Bake in the preheated oven until the cheese is melted, and the ingredients are hot, about 30 minutes. This recipe uses ground buffalo instead of beef.
Blend evaporated milk, rum, cream of coconut, sweetened condensed milk, coconut milk, water, nutmeg, 1 teaspoon cinnamon, and vanilla extract in a blender at high speed until creamy, about 3 minutes; pour into a glass pitcher. Refrigerate coquito until chilled, at least 20 minutes. Pour into glasses and dust with cinnamon. Creamy, tropical coconut beverage made with spices and white rum. It is always requested at my holiday gatherings during Thanksgiving and Christmas time. Serve in glass cups and sprinkle with more cinnamon if desired. Feliz Navidad!
Mash avocados in a bowl. Stir pomegranate seeds, cilantro, green onion, lime juice, serrano chile pepper, salt, and pepper into mashed avocado until well mixed. Pomegranates add a great twist to guacamole! Serve with tortilla chips!
Combine vodka and orange juice in a highball glass and stir to combine. Add ice. This simple mixture of vodka and orange juice reportedly gets its name from original tool used to stir the drink--a screwdriver. You'll get equally good results using a spoon. The screwdriver is a simple but refreshing cocktail made by combining orange juice and vodka over ice.
In a large mixing bowl, dissolve honey and yeast in warm water. Let stand until creamy, about 10 minutes. Stir in oil, salt and 4 cups of flour. Stir in the remaining flour, 1/2 cup at a time, beating well after each addition. When the dough has pulled together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and knead for about 15 minutes. The dough should be soft like a baby's butt and it should not stick to your hands. Lightly oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth and let rise in a warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour. Deflate the dough and turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Divide the dough into two equal pieces and form into loaves. Place the loaves into two lightly greased 9x5 inch loaf pans. Cover the loaves with a damp cloth and let rise until doubled in volume, about 40 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Bake in preheated oven for 45 to 60 minutes, until loaves sound hollow when on the bottom. Serve hot out of the oven or let cool and store for later. This recipe was created in the Unitas mountain range by a Student Conservation Association trail crew. The beauty of this bread is it's versatility. If you don't have enough or any of an ingredient you can usually go without or substitute for it. So go ahead, add milk, eggs, oats, fruits or nuts. You can also try different flours and sweeteners.
Position rack in the center of the oven; preheat to 350 degrees F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper or a silicone baking mat. Whisk all-purpose flour, whole-wheat flour, cocoa powder, baking soda and salt in a medium bowl. Beat egg whites in a large bowl with an electric mixer until foamy, about 1 minute. Beat in granulated sugar in a slow, steady stream. Scrape down the sides, then beat in brown sugar 1 tablespoon at a time. Beat until smooth, about 3 minutes. Beat in vanilla and melted chocolate. Stir in the dry ingredients with a wooden spoon until just incorporated. Drop the batter by tablespoonfuls onto the prepared baking sheet, 1 1/2 inches apart. Bake the cookies until flat yet springy, with slightly cracked tops, 10 to 12 minutes. Cool on the pan for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Let the pan cool for a few minutes before baking another batch; replace parchment paper if torn or scorched. These big, soft, fudgy cookies are like those found in glass jars on bake-shop counters.
Heat 1 tablespoon of oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the shrimp peels and cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat to medium, and add the leeks, carrot and shallots. Cover and cook for 2 minutes to sweat the vegetables. Season with paprika and cayenne pepper, and mix well. Stir in the cognac, white wine, water and fish stock. Simmer gently for 10 minutes. Strain the liquid from the skillet into another skillet, pressing any juices out of the shrimp peels and vegetables. Discard the solids. Return the strained liquid to the heat, and stir in cream. Season with salt and pepper and simmer for 5 minutes over medium-low heat. Remove from the heat, and whisk in the egg yolk. Preheat your oven's broiler. In a separate skillet, heat the remaining olive oil. Add the shrimp; cook and stir for about 1 minute. Divide the shrimp evenly between four oven-safe dishes. Pour the sauce over each portion of shrimp. Place the dishes on a baking sheet. Broil the dishes of shrimp for 2 to 3 minutes, or until nicely browned on the top. Remove from the oven, and sprinkle chives over the top. Scampi (Large shrimp) is served with sauce, flavored with white wine. Makes an excellent starter for a seafood menu.
Preheat oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).  Generously grease the bottom of a 9 x 5 inch loaf pan. Measure oil, bananas, vanilla, eggs, baking mix, sugar, and nuts into a large bowl.  Beat vigorously with a spoon for about 30 seconds.  Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake until a wooden pick inserted in center comes out clean, about 55 to 65 minutes.  Cool for 5 minutes in the pan.  Loosen sides of loaf from the pan.  Remove to a wire rack to cool completely. Delicious with hot cocoa or tea for an afternoon snack.
In a blender or salad dressing shaker, combine oil, sugar, vinegar, onion, salt, mustard, and celery seed. Blend or shake until emulsified. This is a delicious sweet and sour dressing. I've never met anyone that didn't like it.
Heat the broth and potatoes in a 3-quart saucepan over medium-high heat to a boil. Reduce the heat to medium. Cover and cook for 12-15 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Drain the potatoes well in a colander, reserving the broth. Mash the potatoes with a fork with reserved broth and butter to desired consistency. Season to taste. It doesn't get much easier than this simple side that combines just 3 ingredients to make great tasting potatoes the whole crowd will enjoy.
Pulse crabmeat in a food processor several times until minced. Transfer crabmeat to a large bowl. Blend cream cheese in food processor until creamy. Add onion, horseradish, and Worcestershire sauce to cream cheese; blend until smooth. Stir cream cheese mixture into crab mixture until well-combined. For crab mixture into 2 to 3 balls, cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate until firm and chilled, at least 1 hour. Place crab balls on a platter and top with cocktail sauce. Tasty and quick imitation crabmeat appetizer sure to please a crowd. Prepare with enough time to chill! This tastes best with the addition of Tiger Sauce. If you cannot find it (usually in the ketchup/condiment section) and use cocktail sauce instead, remember cocktail sauce contains horseradish and adjust your ingredients accordingly!
Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C.) Lay one crust into a 9 inch pie pan, making sure the edges extend slightly beyond the pan. In a large bowl, mix together white and brown sugars, flour, cornstarch, cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and almond extract. Add the strawberries to the mixture and gently stir to coat thoroughly. Pour into the crust, mounding it slightly in the middle. Cut the second crust into 1/2 inch strips and weave into a lattice over the filling. Roll up the extra dough on the bottom crust to seal down the lattice strips, then press with fingers to form a fluted edge. Dot with butter in the open squares. For a golden crust, brush lattice lightly with milk, then sprinkle with sugar. Bake in the preheated oven for 35 to 40 minutes, or until golden brown. This is a strawberry pie with a top lattice crust that has an extra gourmet kick!
In a large bowl, mix the chicken, creamy salad dressing, pickle relish, apple, pecans, celery, and raisins. Season with salt and pepper. Chill until serving. This is the result of a day at home with my brother and nothing to do. We decided to create a new lunch. Serve on rolls or sandwich bread; this is especially nice if you toast the bread, or use a flavorful whole-grain bread. The chicken can be substituted with turkey, and the ingredients can be rearranged to suit differing tastes. Enjoy!
Combine cucumbers, tomatoes, and onion in a large glass mixing bowl. Stir vinegar and sugar together in a small saucepan over medium-low and bring to a boil; cook and stir until the sugar dissolves. Pour over the vegetable mixture. Marinate mixture in the refrigerator for 30 minutes. Stir the reserved liquid from the herring into the vegetable mixture. Fold herring into the vegetable mixture. Refrigerate 1 hour more before serving. It just so happens I like cucumber salad and pickled herring, so I decided to try this combination and the results are great. You can add your own seasoning to give it some zip, but I prefer just to leave it alone. The prep time and cook time are about the same.
In a large mixing bowl combine oats, wheat germ, wheat bran, oat bran, dried fruit, nuts, sugar, and seeds. Mix well. Store muesli in an airtight container. It keeps for 2 months at room temperature. This is a nutritious and delicious breakfast cereal. Use any type of dried fruit you desire! You can also use almonds in place of walnuts if you like. Wonderful when served in bowls with milk and fresh berries or sliced fresh fruit.
Mix dressing ingredients in a small bowl; keep chilled until ready to toss with salad. (Store in clean jar with lid.) Bring 1 gallon of water and 2 Tbs. of salt to boil in a large soup kettle. Add pasta and, using package times as a guide, boil, stirring frequently and adding asparagus the last 1 minute, until just tender. Drain thoroughly (do not rinse) and dump onto a large, lipped cookie sheet. Set aside to cool while preparing remaining salad ingredients. Place all salad ingredients (except buttermilk dressing) in a large bowl or transfer to a gallon-size zippered bag. (Can be covered and refrigerated several hours at this point.) When ready to serve, add dressing; toss to coat and serve. A tangy buttermilk dressing ties together this pasta salad studded with asparagus, chicken, artichokes, and cherry tomatoes!
Melt 1 tablespoon of butter in a skillet over medium heat. Stir in the garlic and shallot, and cook until the shallot has softened and turned translucent, about 3 minutes. Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of butter, then stir in the mushrooms once the butter has melted. Cook and stir the mushrooms until they begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Pour in the beef broth, wine, and Worcestershire sauce; season with the bay leaf and thyme, and bring to a simmer over medium-high heat. Once simmering, season to taste with salt and pepper, reduce the heat to medium-low, and continue to cook, uncovered until the sauce reduces slightly, about 30 minutes. Dissolve the cornstarch in the cold water, and stir into the simmering sauce until thickened. Remove the bay leaf before serving. I used to visit the restaurant of a friend who was a chef. He made the best mushroom sauce for beef, but would not share his recipe. After trial and error, I think mine comes very close to his. This haute cuisine sauce makes everyday steaks or roasts into something a little more elegant. Serve atop grilled steaks, hamburger steaks, roasted beef or venison. Bon Appetite!
Preheat oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease and flour a 10-inch Bundt(R) pan. In a bowl, mix together the cake mix, tomato soup, water, eggs, canola oil, carrot, and pecans until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into the middle of the cake comes out clean, about 45 minutes. Invert the pan and turn the cake out onto a cooling rack; cool to room temperature. In a bowl, mix together the confectioners' sugar with lemon juice until smooth; drizzle glaze over cake. Not completely from scratch, but still a delicious dessert.
In a food processor or blender, combine onions, wine, vinegar, garlic, salt and pepper.  Process until onions and garlic are pureed.  Add mayonnaise and blend until smooth.  Refrigerate until very cold, and whisk dressing just before serving. This dressing is rich and creamy and goes very well with your favorite salad greens, and can also be used with your favorite cabbage coleslaw recipe as the dressing.
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F. Coat a 9x13 pan with cooking spray. In a large bowl, whisk together sugar, Silk, eggs, (or egg substitute), spices, salt, coconut extract and rum, if using. Stir in 1 1/2 cups flaked coconut. Gently stir in bread cubes until evenly coated. Spoon mixture into prepared pan, cover with plastic wrap and let sit for 30 minutes. Place pan on a cookie sheet and bake for 25 minutes. Sprinkle with remaining 1/2 cup flaked coconut and bake for an additional 25 minutes, or until center springs back. Serve warm. Sugar, spice, and rum (if you like) with coconut and whole grain bread make a rich and delicious bread pudding.
Mix together flour and salt. Cut shortening into flour/salt mixture using a pastry blender, fork or two knives. Stir in water to form a soft dough. On a floured surface, roll out dough very thin with a rolling pin. Cut into 1 inch wide strips (I use a pizza cutter, but a sharp knife works also). Tear 1 inch long pieces of dough from these strips and drop into simmering broth. Cook 10 minutes with the pot lid off, then 10 minutes more with the lid on. Serve with the broth and chicken meat, if using. This recipe was a big hit at our family reunion in 1995. Best  cooked in chicken broth.
Rinse and pick through peas.  Place them in a large pot with the celery, carrots, broth and water.  Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, cover and simmer until peas have fallen apart, 1 to 2 hours.  Season with salt and pepper before serving. To make a delicious Pea Soup without all the fat simply substitute chicken stock for most of the liquid in your favorite recipe!  The soup will cook down and be flavorful, though mild in taste.  My family loves this substitute!
Place cream cheese, sour cream, brown sugar and coffee-flavored liqueur in a medium bowl. Blend together with an electric mixer until smooth. Fold in thawed frozen whipped topping. Chill in the refrigerator until serving. This is a creamy, luscious, coffee-flavored dip for fruit -- strawberries, tart apples, pineapple, grapes, etc. It's perfect for bridal or baby showers, and it's quick and easy to make.
Combine potatoes and chicken broth in a slow cooker. Cook potatoes on Low for 3 hours. Add cauliflower and continue cooking on Low another 3 hours. Stir milk, butter, sour cream, black pepper, garlic powder, paprika, and salt into the potato mixture. Mash with a potato masher or blend with an immersion blender to desired consistency. Continue cooking until hot, about 10 minutes more. We couldn't find a mashed potato and cauliflower in the slow cooker recipe, so we combined several recipes into this one.
In a mixing bowl, combine the cucumbers, vinegar, sugar, celery seed, pepper, salt, chopped onion and lemon juice. Toss, cover and chill for 4 hours. This is my Grandmother's favorite cucumber recipe.
Preheat oven to 275 degrees F (135 degrees C). In a large glass or metal mixing bowl, beat egg whites until foamy.  Add cream of tartar and salt and beat until whites stand in soft peaks.  Add sugar gradually and beat until very stiff. Fold in chopped nuts and 1 teaspoon. vanilla. Turn the meringue into a buttered 9 inch pie plate. Spread over bottom and sides of plate,  building up the sides 1/2 inch above the edge of the plate.  Bake in preheated oven for 60 minutes.  Cool. In the top of a double boiler, heat chocolate, stirring occasionally, until chocolate is melted and smooth. Remove from heat and stir in coffee. In a large bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks. Whisk in vanilla. Fold 1/3 of the cream into the melted chocolate, then fold the chocolate mixture back into the whipped cream until no streaks remain. Work quickly to prevent the chocolate from seizing up. Spoon mixture into meringue shell. Chill for 2 hours in the refrigerator. This pie is absolutely the most sinfully delicious ever.  The crust is the really unique feature!  It originally came from a restaurant in La Cienga, CA some 35 years ago.
Prepare a large pot with cooking spray and place over medium heat; cook the beef stew meat in the pot until completely browned on all sides, 5 to 7 minutes. Add the onions; cook and stir until the onions begin to soften, about 5 minutes. Stir the water, ketchup, Worcestershire sauce, vinegar, brown sugar, paprika, salt, and mustard into the beef and onion mixture. Place a cover on the pot, reduce heat to low, and simmer the mixture until the beef is tender, about 2 1/2 hours. Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a rolling boil. Cook the egg noodles at a boil until cooked through yet firm to the bite, about 5 minutes; drain. Serve the goulash over the noodles. This is the Hungarian goulash my mother made and her mother made; it's the only one I know
Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). In a roasting pan, place brisket fat side up. In a small bowl, combine cola beverage, onion soup mix, and chile sauce.

Place the venison into a large bowl. Sprinkle with salt, pepper, and garlic; toss to combine. Place venison into canning jar along with onion and bell pepper. Jars should be filled to within 1/2 inch of the top. Wipe rim with a clean, damp cloth, and seal with lid and ring. Place jar into a pressure canner filled with water according to manufacturer's directions. Affix lid and bring to a boil with the pressure valve open. Boil for 5 minutes before closing the pressure valve. Bring to a pressure of 10 psi, then reduce heat in order to maintain this pressure. Process for 75 minutes, watching gauge closely so the pressure stays at 10 psi. After 75 minutes, turn off heat and allow the canner to cool until the gauge reads 0 psi. Once the pressure has subsided and the canner is safe to open, remove the jar to cool on a rack. The jar will seal with a pop as it cools; refrigerate the jar if it does not seal. Properly sealed jars may be stored in a cool, dark area.
